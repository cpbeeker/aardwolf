@GYou answer 'go get him'

@CGale, the waterfront merchant@C asks, @c"@CHow're you doing, Omerye?@c"
@GTrachx answers 'or maybe I am wrong about cexits after all'
@GAnaristos answers 'since scripts can treat cexits and portal the same way, that is they insert a sequence into the speedwalk, players tend to think of them as being similar.'
@GTrachx answers 'apparently in that room with ships there is no exit "enter ship", just an object ship you can enter'
@GAnaristos answers 'but again, a cexit is a direction just north or south.'
@GAnaristos answers 'just like*'
@CA tribesman@C exclaims, @c"@CBe quiet!  I am hunting the anaconda!@c"

@R(@WImm@R)@r Abelinc: let's take a pretty simple and what in my mind is a benign-if-cliche one...a leather dominatrix pointing to a dude and ordering him "lick my feet"...neatly fits the definition of "degrading", but also I think neatly fits the definition of "no harm" (provided nobody's truly a slave, blah blah legalese)

@R(@WImm@R)@r Mirrim: That Abelinc has a really specific fantasy?

@R(@WImm@R)@r Raded: Abelinc has a specific fetish that he should expand on and Liber spends a lot of time googling people to get mad about.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Liber: Abelinc: to be specific, that was a letter written by a shitload of professors from different countries to the shithead in charge, supporting the change :)

@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: no, it's not like a drug, people just don't understand what being a customer means. I've seen people go in a shop and complain about this and that and end up getting something they really didn't want because they were cowed into buying it. All they have to do is walk out. If every time a shopkeeper treats a customer like shit they walk out, they will either change their attitude or go out of business. But if the customer puts up with it then they only have themselves to blame. There is very little in the world that on can't do without.

@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: people do need it though, what do you mean
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: people don't need the internet
@R(@WImm@R)@r Raded: as long as you're rich enough to not need a job
@R(@WImm@R)@r Raded: how do you get a job or get into a school without using the internet?
@R(@WImm@R)@r Grimvald: there are parts of the internet that all of us need
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: why not, because X years ago we were living in caves? times are different, I think it's pretty needed now
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: gee, I don't know, the way people did it for hundreds of years before the advent of the internet about 20 years ago?
@R(@WImm@R)@r Metria: And go back to waiting in line at the DMV for silly shit like renewing your registration
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: that's what I just said, times change
@R(@WImm@R)@r Grimvald: noone needs the cat videos, or this mud even, but it makes life much easier today
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: you could be competitive without inet hundreds of years ago, btu not anymore
@R(@WImm@R)@r Wars: very needed I know people that have wi-fi only phones

@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: it saves time, even if there are alternatives
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: times do change, but that doesn't mean the old ways won't work. You can still get a job by getting off you ass and going with your resume in hand to a place of business and applying for a job.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Raded: no, you can't
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: so if you could spend 10 hours earning money, it'd be 6-7 because you have to do things the slow way
@R(@WImm@R)@r Raded: maybe at some mom and pop hardware store in the sticks but not at a normal place of employment

@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: well, that's how I got my job.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Modi: just need a number to call and log into aard, phone modem
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: and all the jobs before that.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Metria: Is your job making buggy whips?
@R(@WImm@R)@r Wars: for some jobs that would work fine for others not...
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: no
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: of course it won't work, you let them tell you want won't work. Wow, the land of sheep.

@R(@WImm@R)@r Metria: You talk a big game, but when the electric company hikes your rates you bend over and take it, you don't go off grid
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: you need a job as much as the job needs you. Maybe not you, in particular, but industry can't get by without workers (yet). So if you can't be met halfway and you let them stick it to you you deserve what you get.
@CBardus gossips 'thanks'
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: you can't work here unless you apply online, ok, so if no one applies online how long are they going to sing that song?
@R(@WImm@R)@r Metria: I need a job a hell of a lot more than my job needs me. Without my job, I don't pay my mortgage. Without me, they just hire someone else. See my earlier comment about 323 million people.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: yes, Metria, make sure you have your hat in your hand when you apply.
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: you have to know your value tho
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: but online apps save you time
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: so you earn more
@R(@WImm@R)@r Metria: Sure Aphelion, I just march on up to the company and kick the door in and say look here motherfucker, you're going to hire me
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: I understand that it saves time, but they are not a necessity.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Wars: so the people that choose not to boycot get the job??? Ill be one of them so I can support my fam
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: but it is a necessity, if we both have the same potential, I'd always make more money than you
@cYou tell Dexx 'how much you got on the focus?'
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: well, if we both have the same potential a head-to-head interview solves the problem.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Modi: some kind of power to the people would be cool to see.. 
@R(@WImm@R)@r Modi: just one day a month where we turn all the power off 
@R(@WImm@R)@r Wars: it will never come to a head to head interview if they only accept online apps and your the only one out of the two refusing
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: I think the US is the one of the few countries where the general strike is not used as a weapon by the people. Some deomcracy.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Metria: You haven't been paying attention. The United States is not a democracy.
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: inet is needed for research, which comps are hiring, are they a good company, see the salary ranges for th e state
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: the only one, of one of a few countries*
@R(@WImm@R)@r Wars: your resume took weeks through the mail theirs took seconds through email...
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: it's just ridiculous advantage not to have
@CThe Fortune Teller@C asks, @c"@CThank you for all your help.  Do you want to go to @GOz@C or to the @GWizard@C?@c"
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: saying it's doable it's like saying let's pup in fens cuz it's doable
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: you carry it with you wars, what mail?
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: you have never gone to a company and applied for a job?
@R(@WImm@R)@r Grimvald: not for 20 years
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: wow
@CYou say 'glass'

@R(@WImm@R)@r Wars: so now your limiting your job access to what you can walk/drive to?
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: in 30 years when you're ready to retire but you're still poor, you'd feel quite stupid for not taking all the advantages you had

@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: I don't want a job in east bumfuck, I want a job here in whatever city I am living in. If I want a job elsewhere, that is anther process. So can go to whereever I hope to work and apply for the job.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Metria: Aphelion, what year is it where you are?
@R(@WImm@R)@r Mirrim: and get told to apply online?
@R(@WImm@R)@r Grimvald: and what if there are no jobs where you are?
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: 2017
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: but now I understand what is going on.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: sheep
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: no it's not about beeing a sheep
@R(@WImm@R)@r Grimvald: lolololol there's that word again
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: please let me work here :(
@R(@WImm@R)@r Mirrim: the correct term is sheeple

@CGwynyfar@C says 'nope'
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: anyone can use the internet, the point is that if the internet collapsed, the world would go on. Worse things have happened and the world has gone on. Look at Berlin after or Tokyo after WWII.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Daresia: i think trophy wife/servant might fit that
@CDexx@C asks 'whose pageboy hat?'
@R(@WImm@R)@r Aphelion: the black death also comes to mind.
@CGehn@C says 'urania's circle of stars'
@R(@WImm@R)@r Grimvald: it would go on, yes. but it would go on much less efficently
@CYou say 'Thank you kindly.'
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: yes but

@R(@WImm@R)@r Liber: interesting read (and a very interesting presentation): http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/poor-millennials/
@R(@WImm@R)@r Pumpkin: why are rents so high? Anyone have ideas?
@R(@WImm@R)@r Pumpkin: to me it seems like high rents are gutting the whole generation
@R(@WImm@R)@r Trachx: because owners want to get higher returns on their capital
@R(@WImm@R)@r Pumpkin: greed has been part of humanity for millions of years, it cannot be the explanation today
@R(@WImm@R)@r Pumpkin: any other ideas please?
@R(@WImm@R)@r Trachx: nothing has changed
@R(@WImm@R)@r Pumpkin: rents were not high for millions of years, it's a recent phenomenon
@R(@WImm@R)@r Trachx: Roman slave had more rights than current "free" employee
@R(@WImm@R)@r Trachx: now you are free do do anything you want, if you have enough money
@R(@WImm@R)@r Trachx: if you do not, well, you need to dedicate your life to work, then you are free
@R(@WImm@R)@r Method: rents are also driven from supply and demand
@R(@WImm@R)@r Liber: I'd say that the society is a hell lot more dynamic. people move more, often change jobs more often, change residence more often. there's less or no incentive to build a "relationship" (be it work related, or rent, or even personal), and, well, anyone is milking the cow as much as they can
@R(@WImm@R)@r Trachx: I remember several years ago some talk with chinese worker - basically her life was - wake up, eat, go to work, eat, sleep, repeat
@R(@WImm@R)@r Trachx: there is enough wealth in the world so all poeple could get their share and live peaceful life
@R(@WImm@R)@r Trachx: but that required that 1% of owners need to give away their wealth
@R(@WImm@R)@r Liber: it didn't, doesn't and won't work like that. ever. unfortunatelly :)
@R(@WImm@R)@r Ansip: greed is main point... and nowdays society humans have alot different incomes, which allowes to filter out those ppl who are willing to pay more...
@R(@WImm@R)@r Ansip: who are willing to pay more... thats like "supply and demand"... based on alot different incomes nowdaya :p
@R(@WImm@R)@r Trachx: also there is always generation fight - 20, 40, 60 - oldest gathered most wealth, young ones have more-or-less nothing
@RINFO: New post #@W48254@R in forum @WForsale@R from @WWire@R Subj: @WRank4Ear forsale
@R(@WImm@R)@r Trachx: in XV+ century when you were a noble son or a noble daugher - you were free but even your marriage was arranged by older generation
@R(@WImm@R)@r Ansip: if all continues same way as recently, then middle class people proportion will fall... very few of them became as rich ppl and most of them will become as poor ppl... better tech (automotion) and laws, taxes supports it 
@RINFO: 5 minutes of bonus experience remaining.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Trachx: there are ideas to introduce guaranteed income, then when you are worker you are elite, because there won't be enough work for all people
@R(@WImm@R)@r Trachx: but basically that is just one more poverty class
@R(@WImm@R)@r Trachx: that will eventually lead to similar effects like stanford prison experiment

@R(@WImm@R)@r Anaristos: you can have a federal republic or a simple republic, they both operate the same way. The difference is how much autonomy do the landowners have.

@C(Gossip) Rokshel thanks Trachx heartily.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Anaristos: it is telling that the 'lower house' directly represents the people, while the 'upper house' represent the states.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Anaristos: you may even be wrong
@R(@WImm@R)@r Anaristos: what makes a republic a republic is not how the structure is formed but how the governants are chosen.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Liber: now YOU are being pedantic :)
@R(@WImm@R)@r Anaristos: you can have republics that have provinces directly governed directly by the nation's legislature, or you can have a federation where each province/state has a large degree of autonomy.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Liber: at least I was talking about your electors vs. direct vote. both ways are specific to a republic. the distinction comes from being a federation

@R(@WImm@R)@r Liber: the term is 'federal republic'. I was saying that electors didn't 'happen' because you're a republic, but because you're a federation. the latter is what made it necessary to implement that system
@R(@WImm@R)@r Anaristos: I inferred that you expected a republic which is not a federation to be different in its morphology.

@R(@WImm@R)@r Liber: I don't think "democracy" is a form of government

@R(@WImm@R)@r Anaristos: it can be, theoretically.

@R(@WImm@R)@r Liber: anyway, to clarify the earlier argument about republic AND federation: a square is, at the same time, a rectangle and a rhombus. if I say that it having all sides equal comes from being a rhombus, doesn't imply that it's NOT a rectangle anymore. but, well, maybe part of that was lost in the translation (not my native language, obviously)

@GYuna Tech@w: @CI cannot place any of the plugin pop-up windows in MUSHclient outside of the Aardwolf World window (i.e. the "chat log", the one where all the text appears) and apparently you're supposed to be able to do that. I'm on Windows 10.
@GDurel Tech@w: @CNo, you can't move the plugin windows outside of the main client window.  You move them around *inside* of that window
@R(@WImm@R)@r Khannon: Nerf winds maze part plx
@GYuna Tech@w: @CNot the main client window, the Aardwolf log window inside of the main client window.
@GYuna Tech@w: @CThe plugin windows are all tethered to the Aardwolf log window, no matter how I resize the log window.

@GYuna Tech@w: @CIf I try to drag the Mapper window outside of it, it'll go out of bounds and be partially invisible (anything not "inside" of the Aardwolf window). If I try to move the health/mana/moves/etc. bar window, it'll stick to the bottom of the Aardwolf window (right above the input prompt) and the mouse pointer becomes a red circle with a slash going through it.
@GTech@w: @CSo what happens when you resize your main window as small as it will go, do all the miniwindows dissapear?
@RGlobal Quest@Y:@w @mGlobal quest # 7356@w has been cancelled due to lack of activity.

@GTech@w: @Copps
@GYuna Tech@w: @CNope. Bottom right corner resizes the entire Aardwolf window. And bottom right corner right above prompt, where the buttom to resize the main Aardwolf window seems to supposed to be, does nothing because it lacks the triangle needed
@RINFO: The player rankings have been updated.
@GGrimvald Tech@w: @Chave you dragged the bottom of the mini-window below your prompt?
@GDurel Tech@w: @CIs your window too small to display the entire miniwindow inside?  Do you need to scroll down to the bottom so that you can see the bottom of your mini-window?
@GYuna Tech@w: @CWhat mini-window?
@GYuna Tech@w: @CThe health bar?
@GYuna Tech@w: @COr mapper?
@GGrimvald Tech@w: @Cthe one you're trying to resize
@GYuna Tech@w: @CYou mean the main chat window? No way to drag it below the prompt. No way to drag it all.
@GTech@w: @Cif you grab the top of the main window you can try moving it
@GGrimvald Tech@w: @Cis the layout locked?
@GTech@w: @Cmaybe part of your window is missing. think that's what durel is getting at
@GGrimvald Tech@w: @Caard layout unlock
@GDurel Tech@w: @CIf the bottom of the window you want to resize is off-screen below the prompt then you would need to scroll it up so that you can get to the bottom
@GYuna Tech@w: @CI can move only the main Aardwolf Worlds window.
@GYuna Tech@w: @CI don't know what you mean by locked layout.
@GGrimvald Tech@w: @Cthere's a way to lock the windows so they can't be moved accidentally, the command is aard layout lock/unlock
@GYuna Tech@w: @CAnd where would you input that command?
@GTech@w: @Cthe prompt
@GTech@w: @Cinput
@GYuna Tech@w: @CNo, that just sends it to the MUD. There needs to be some code before it to make sure it's the client that receives the command.
@GTech@w: @Cif that doesn't work then you are missing something
@GTech@w: @Cit works fine for me
@GYuna Tech@w: @CJust inputting "aard layout lock/unlock" gets me.
@GNegader Tech@w: @Cif i type aard layout lock, it returns Current layout lock status: LOCKED 
@GYuna Tech@w: @C"There is no layout within Aardwolf".
@GYuna Tech@w: @CYou may be running a plugin I don't have.
@GTech@w:@C Grimvald boggles at the concept.
@GGrimvald Tech@w: @Cdo you have an alias called 'aard' ?
@GYuna Tech@w: @CNo. I don't understand why you think this is supposed to work normally. Anything you input into the prompt is automatically sent to Aardwolf, not the client. It is ONLY sent to the client if you have an alias for it or prefix the text with symbols that will tell MUSH to execute it as a script and not to send it to Aardwolf.
@CDawsey gossips 'Mordist can you send me a tell please'
@GYuna Tech@w: @CYOU are probably running an alias (or a plugin that runs an alias) for the command "aard".
@GTech@w: @Cunless a plugin has it as an alias

@GAbelinc Tech@w: @Cyuna: you did NOT start with the aardclient...you then tried to migrate to the aardclient...
@GAbelinc Tech@w: @Calmost all of your issues have been because of that very fact
@RINFO: New post #@W2489@R in forum @WEpics@R from @WAlai@R Subj: @WInferno Run Results
@RINFO: The player rankings have been updated.
@GAbelinc Tech@w: @Cthe other day, you ran the aardclient's installer on your other MUSHclient folder...however, that isn't the same as installing and starting with the aardclient...the main difference being that the installer is meant to not mess with a pre-existing Aardwolf.mcl file, which is what contains the aliases/triggers/AND-LIST-OF-PLUGINS that you have previously defined
@GAbelinc Tech@w: @Cso you never turned on most of the "default everybody-gets-them-on" plugins which define the Aardmush experience
@GYuna Tech@w: @CSo if you install it clean, all plugins are loaded by default?
@GCrowley Tech@w: @CYes, but you'll need to reinstall any of your existing plugins.
@GAbelinc Tech@w: @Cnot all, but all of the standard ones...there are a few in the plugins folder not installed by design

@GTrachx answers '2 blacksmiths in a group usually do not split mobs evenly, in most cases every blacksmith will hammerswin his own set of mobs'
@GTrachx answers 'once one of them killed all mobs in his set (ie those he was fighting directly) then he assists another blacksmith, but assistance is fighting one mob - so your hammerswing hits only 1 mob in such case'
@GTrachx answers 'unless you rescue the other blacksmith and "redirect" mobs to you, but then I guess 1st blacksmith is no longer directly in fight with other mobs, so his hammerswing hits just remaining mobs'
@GTrachx answers 'anyway it seems that formula is like: X - number of mobs group fight, 1 blacksmith = X hammerswing hits, 2 blacksmiths = (X + 1) hammerswing hits (that +1 only if assisting, when in aggro room you get total X hits split among all blacksmiths)'

@GDayGlow answers 'I always liked pthief, I think the biggest drawback (especially at SH) is that for max damage, you have to start every fight with backstab'

@GBamboo Tech@w: @CYes
@GAnaristos Tech@w: @Cthere is an implied ability to use COM objects with mush, so the sky is the limit.
@GMetria Tech@w: @CYou could also set up a web server that does what you want, and then make calls to it
@GAnaristos Tech@w: @CI've yet to do it but I did discuss it with Gammon once and he said it would work.
@GKalsch Tech@w: @Cyea ive got the web server capabilities - was just curious on how to communicate from mush to said serber
@GAnaristos Tech@w: @Cwell, a web server is actually a great idea but if you can also do it with tcp or named pipes.

@C(Gossip) Elderfox smirks.
@GAnaristos Tech@w: @CI am doing it with cmud (I am in the alpha testing stage) where I send invdata to a COM object who broadcasts the data using a windows service, there are listeners for invdata out there that wil use it to do various things such as updating a database, etc.
@GAnaristos Tech@w: @Cthe point is I don't care (as a the aardwolf client) what is done to the data. I just put it out there for some object that may be interested.
@GAnaristos Tech@w: @Cthat relieves the client of the responsibility of processing the data
@GKalsch Tech@w: @Ci suppose it was naive of me to hope there was some much command like "pingwebsite (URL VARS)" :P

@GAnaristos Tech@w: @Cyou can do that, but the problem is that the client will connect to it as if it were a mud server so you have to act accordingly.

@C(Gossip) Thoondar starts to giggle to himself like a little girl.
@GAnaristos Tech@w: @Cif you can convince a website to connect to aardmush you will be in great shape, but I have a feeling that the website will have to be a server in fact.
@GAnaristos Tech@w: @Cit is an interesting idea :)
@GEndymion Tech@w: @Cwait when is a website not a server? :p
@GKalsch Tech@w: @Cdoes it have to be a connection though vs literally just pinging a site with some GET vars once?
@GMetria Tech@w: @CIt could be argued the website is the data, not the server providing it
@GAnaristos Tech@w: @CI mean a sever that is understood by the client.
@GMetria Tech@w: @CCan we not call it 'pinging', which is something else entirely?
@GEndymion Tech@w: @Ci've set up a mob database on a server and used a querystring to serve up a page of data.  its neat
@GAnaristos Tech@w: @Csure, you can do that. That is going out not in.
@GAnaristos Tech@w: @Cthe problem is when you want to query the world for data you have to look like a real server, unless you want to write scripts to deal with the website (*srun)
@CThroxx gossips 'Fetchy la bouche, which is algonquin for, " Bring the cow."'
@C(Gossip) Elderfox is trying to read two notes at once! Quick, write him some more!
@C(Gossip) Thoondar turns cowlike eyes on you, chews his cud, and moos plaintively.
@GAnaristos Tech@w: @CI am talking about mush (or cmud) connecting on some tcp/ip channel and communicating with the website. The one limiting factor is that you can't influence how the client is going to talk to the website. The protocol is already in place.
@GEndymion Tech@w: @Ci used http.request and did a loadstring of the page returned which was formatted as a lua table
@GTech@w: @Ccouldn't you teach a script what do to with it?
@GMetria Tech@w: @CThat's pretty clever, Endymion

@CThoondar gossips 'Thoondar's father's business is his business!'
@GAnaristos Tech@w: @Ccmud is very seductive that way, once you go out into the 'real world' and start writng applications to interact with the client, there is no limit :)
@GAnaristos Tech@w: @Ccmud doesn't have a way of writing plugins, but you can write an application that does the same thing as a plug in since it will have access to all the cmud commands and functions.

@GTech@w: @Cnaughty cmud
@GAnaristos Tech@w: @Cthere is one trick, you have to load cmud first, if you don't load cmud first the application will load a fresh copy that won't be the same one you will use when you finally load it.

@R(@WImm@R)@r Angyer: which masses?
@R(@WImm@R)@r Narsham: possibly due to the fact that some people cannot stand at all. Of course, few of them play pro football.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Turie: It has everything to do it. There is no legal obligation to stand for the National Anthem. The pledge is more important.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Arist: there's nothing in the flag code that says a dog can't play football

@R(@WImm@R)@r Turie: He cannot due to being at face level?
@R(@WImm@R)@r Raded perks up, something must have grabbed his attention.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Raded: where's the cock
@R(@WImm@R)@r Pleiades hits a peacock on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper and says, "No!".
@R(@WImm@R)@r Raded looks at a peacock and goes "Hmmmm."
@R(@WImm@R)@r Pleiades glares at a peacock.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Raded: can peacocks fly?
@R(@WImm@R)@r Pleiades: if you pee on them
@R(@WImm@R)@r Turie: Who thinks the two will mate with the peacock?
@R(@WImm@R)@r Raded crosses his arms and nods slowly and sagely to Pleiades.
@RINFO: HARDCORE Domen has been killed by Mael at level 56.
@C(Gossip) Starling skips around the room, cackling gleefully. Maybe you should leave?
@R(@WImm@R)@r Pleiades: Icecool                        ???
@R(@WImm@R)@r Raded: ???
@R(@WImm@R)@r Magna: unfo: because they stack
@R(@WImm@R)@r Unforgiven: Yeah, because ya know, Warriors and Thieves practice curse and train up Int.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Morn: can't dissolve sloth
@R(@WImm@R)@r Crimzon: yo anyone heard of. curse?
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: and if no curse, there's no possibility of word failing
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: in an open room
@R(@WImm@R)@r Gritznakka: I know, I have a tonne of Int.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Unforgiven: True, but now you are giving one class two mechanics to keep people from leaving.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Magna: they practice curse, but they don't train up int so they can't land it
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: a solution might be increasing pvp dmg
@R(@WImm@R)@r Metria: So if each class only gets one mechanic... you're saying they should group up with others.
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: so fights dont take 5 years
@R(@WImm@R)@r Metria: And we're right back to 5v1 :D
@MAuction@w: @RB@rlood o@wf Heroe@Ws@M SOLD to Crimzon@M for @Y10,000 @Mgold.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Unforgiven: To be fair, blockexit was for preventing people from "Fleeing" not making a tactical retreat
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: and decrease that based on people attacking you
@CA female wood elf gardener@C says, @c"@CGreetings, Omerye, welcome to my garden. Here you will find peace and tranquillity. The hedgehogs who live here can get up to some mischief, though they are harmless.@c"
@R(@WImm@R)@r Gritznakka: Or just except they ran, and you won.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Morn: so trez, if more people join your side of the fight your damage goes down?
@R(@WImm@R)@r Crimzon: high ups shouldnt be complaining
@R(@WImm@R)@r Unforgiven: No Metria. But if you are a primary warrior or thief, you should have the ability to keep people engaged in combat.
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: ye
@R(@WImm@R)@r Roume: anyone planning to run winds tonight?
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: although might be a pain to code
@R(@WImm@R)@r Escobar: No, we're too busy arguing
@R(@WImm@R)@r Gritznakka: The stat doesn't give you any advantage.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Crimzon: i had a team of fibe and a big t9 killed all 5 in 3 mins
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: I know there's a modifier in pvp already
@R(@WImm@R)@r Asuras: has a timer sadly
@R(@WImm@R)@r Unforgiven: In like 10 hours Roume
@R(@WImm@R)@r Morn: I can run
@R(@WImm@R)@r Unforgiven: Ok, afk
@R(@WImm@R)@r Unforgiven: Glad we could have this discussion
@R(@WImm@R)@r Crimzon: later
@R(@WImm@R)@r Escobar: Someone make a quick point to lure Unfo back
@R(@WImm@R)@r Unforgiven snickers with Escobar about their shared secret.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Gritznakka: Idea to fix pk, track how many times a player has fled from you, and how many times you've fled from a pk situation.
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: too many different reasons for that
@R(@WImm@R)@r Myrddin: my favorite activity of all times is 1v1 PK at SH, anybody have thoughts on this?
@R(@WImm@R)@r Unforgiven: Point is, OPK is Open Player Killing.
@MAuction@w: @MYuna is auctioning @Wthe Timeless Seal of the Ages@M (@YLevel 160,@M Num @Y127@M). Current bid is @Y100.

@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: so go away
@R(@WImm@R)@r Magna: I had a lot of fun with 1v1 PK at SH when I was T1
@R(@WImm@R)@r Mael: so not open clanned player killing?  noted
@R(@WImm@R)@r Magna: (for all "me" and "I"s, I mean Abelinc, not Magna or Biker)
@R(@WImm@R)@r Mael: open pkclanned, i should say
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: I like pvp stats added to eq in pvp activities
@R(@WImm@R)@r Arist: opk = old players kvetching
@R(@WImm@R)@r Metria: That sounds right
@R(@WImm@R)@r Morn: I bet SH pk is really fun, just give me another year to press my aoe macro every 20 seconds
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: you better get the staves going too
@R(@WImm@R)@r Morn: not big enough for that yet :(
@R(@WImm@R)@r Gritznakka: I bet pre-sh pk is better.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Gritznakka: Way more variety
@R(@WImm@R)@r Mael: pre sh is indeed more fun
@R(@WImm@R)@r Magna: I hear the zons have a starburst staff
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: pre-sh has pretty much always been better
@R(@WImm@R)@r Gritznakka: Don't have to deal with 80k hp
@R(@WImm@R)@r Mael: i died to djv today, because i don't check levels, it's more interesting that way!
@R(@WImm@R)@r Morn: pre-sh opk is the most fun I've had in this game (perhaps save for lasertag)
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: when the backstab landed, omg
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: feels so good
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: or you sneak in and strangle skinner
@R(@WImm@R)@r Redryn: should remove level check! ! 
@R(@WImm@R)@r Gritznakka: Well you nullified your opinion by mentioning lasertag. :p
@R(@WImm@R)@r Magna slaps Redryn.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Mael: although the 'strangle the t9 then go pup' game is fun too
@R(@WImm@R)@r Redryn: it's not a stat! 
@R(@WImm@R)@r Metria: Toneloc's offline, SOMEONE had to take his role. Thanks Redryn.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Morn: wasn't an opinion, but rather a fact
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: milo is live on youtube again btw
@R(@WImm@R)@r Morn: yiannapopopolodopulous?
@R(@WImm@R)@r Redryn: i/m/p shouldn't affect pvp too since they're not stats
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: ye
@R(@WImm@R)@r Gritznakka: Omg isn't it the best when you land a strangle on someone who should beat your ass, and then you can just walk away.
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: no it's best to strangle, backstab, balor, immolate and they start the fight at 20% hps
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: feelsgoodman
@CThe Gateguard@C exclaims, @c"@CWelcome to the fair!@c"
@CThe Gateguard@C exclaims, @c"@CYou'll find lots of excitement here. Don't miss the tournament!@c"
@CThe Gateguard@C says, @c"@CI can never remember the rest of my lines...@c"
@R(@WImm@R)@r Redryn: you forgot web and curse
@R(@WImm@R)@r Mael: ya, remember when everyone was a thief/mage?  not boring at all
@R(@WImm@R)@r Redryn: and dispel
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: well during the strangle
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: pre-sh I cant remember if dispel was a thing
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: I think it was, if you could web
@R(@WImm@R)@r Mael: not really
@R(@WImm@R)@r Redryn: it works iirc
@R(@WImm@R)@r Gritznakka: I have 70 int, I don't dispel shit.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Morn: it never hits
@R(@WImm@R)@r Redryn: I'd only do during strangle though
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: ye I think around level 100 Ive definitely seen dispels
@R(@WImm@R)@r Escobar: Ask the greatest mind in PK about pre-SH PK, Toneloc.
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: Joker was the mid range pk god back then
@R(@WImm@R)@r Metria: He's been offline a day, anyone know where he lives? We should get the police to do a wellness check.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Mael: shit, i died to joker so many times
@R(@WImm@R)@r Escobar: Hopefully he took the Tide pod challenge.
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: there was a czech called crowax
@R(@WImm@R)@r TrEz: he was strong too
@R(@WImm@R)@r Magna: man, now I've got steve miller band in my head

@R(@WImm@R)@r Taeryn: It's not poisonous.  Pfft.  It's a cleaning agent.  It makes your insides sparkle.
@R(@WImm@R)@r Raded: the government wants to tell you its poisonous

@R(@WImm@R)@r Gritznakka: Or detergen resiue -> Metrias mom.

@GDurel Tech@w: @CHas anyone successfully used the new(ish) gmcpconfig options on aard?  I've been playing with it and I'm not seeing the behavior I expected.  I can use sendgmcp to set an option and then use gmcp to read back that option without any trouble.  However if I don't manually set an option and attempt to read the current state it returns an empty result.  It's almost like I'm just reading valued cached in the gmcp helper instead of reading from the mud.
@RINFO: 1 minute of bonus experience remaining.
@GDurel Tech@w: @CShould I be able to read something like invmon's state from aard without manually setting it up first?
