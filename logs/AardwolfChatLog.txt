@w[04 Nov 09:11:11] @GRebornatus questions 'anyone has an URL with teh SW for areas from aardwolf plaza hotel?'
@w[04 Nov 09:11:26] @GAbelinc answers 'the mapper will automatically make the SWs'
@w[04 Nov 09:12:06] @GAbelinc answers 'so once you put the amulet into the mapper with the aardhotel as destination, it'll update the room-to-room speedwalks to take those into account'
@w[04 Nov 09:12:28] @GRebornatus questions 'that's look great'
@w[04 Nov 09:13:27] @GAbelinc answers 'you can see what speedwalks it makes by using "mapper where <some area's entrance ID>"'
@w[04 Nov 09:15:18] @GAbelinc answers 'another thing that you should do is go to every open clanhall, see if they have an "area exit" room with exits to 4-5 areas...after you go through that room, the mapper will have even better speedwalks to not only those areas, but areas near them as well'
@w[04 Nov 09:15:52] @GKitCarson answers 'yep, it's great... once the mapper knows portals use them really effectiely... even using them to port you to a zone near the one you haveto reach and dont have a portal for'

@w[04 Nov 09:34:29] @GByrnatha answers 'it's in spamreducesomewhere.'
@w[04 Nov 09:34:34] @GByrnatha answers 'it's in spamreduce somewhere.'

@w[04 Nov 09:35:06] @GKarlijn questions 'I would be really interested in knowing on what criteria base their purchase of mastery'
@w[04 Nov 09:35:19] @GKarlijn questions 'people* base'
@w[04 Nov 09:36:15] @GAbelinc answers 'most people base it on the damagetype that they mostly produce, based on their pclass'
@w[04 Nov 09:36:25] @G(Answer) Raded nods at Abelinc.
@w[04 Nov 09:36:59] @GAbelinc answers 'so for me, I have electric (spear of odin), fire (immolate), and some pierce (many of my aarddaggers)'
@w[04 Nov 09:37:06] @GKarlijn answers 'right, but does that mean changing your mastery at higher tiers? Or does it mean sticking to one pclass?'
@w[04 Nov 09:37:16] @GRaded answers 'either or. you can rebuild mastery.'
@w[04 Nov 09:37:23] @GAbelinc answers 'yes, one of those options ;-)'
@w[04 Nov 09:37:55] @GRaded answers 'I'm a ppsi so I have mostly mental mastery but use bash as a secondary damtype, so I have some mastery there too.'
@w[04 Nov 09:38:46] @GAbelinc answers 'I'm a "mage at heart", my main character has always been (and will always be) a mage on any game...my alts have changed pclasses a couple times though, I can use those to experiment'
@w[04 Nov 09:38:51] @GKarlijn answers 'ok, I think I understand now. If you are a spellcaster you would use a damage type that corresponds to your best attack, and as melee you would probably use physical damage type'
@w[04 Nov 09:39:23] @GAbelinc answers 'as melee, you would pay attention to your skills...you can choose any damtype for weapons to match'
@w[04 Nov 09:40:12] @GRaded answers 'warrior and thief can be flexible but ranger (earth) and paladin (light) are pretty straightforward'
@w[04 Nov 09:40:34] @GRaded answers '"allsp (class) combat" and look at the damtype of the highest level skill, generally.'

@CMayor LaPorta@C says, @c"@CAlright then, let's get things rolling... Haha get it? Rolling...@c"
@CMayor LaPorta@C says, @c"@CWell then, a quick rundown of the rules before we get started:@c"
@CMayor LaPorta@C says, @c"@CFirst, each player takes a turn throwing their stone trying to get it closer to the center of the target as possible, 10 being the furthest and 2 being the closest.@c"
@CMayor LaPorta@C says, @c"@CSecond, if no one person hits the bullseye then the person closest to the bullseye is the winner and the other player takes a shot.@c"
@CMayor LaPorta@C says, @c"@CThird, if either player hits the bullseye the opposing player must take a shot. This also applies if both players hit the bullseye.@c"
@CMayor LaPorta@C says, @c"@CFinally, if both players tie then the round is over and there is no winner for that round. The last person standing wins the game. Also, if you wish to end the game simply '@Gforfeit@C'.@c"

@CDexx gossips 'last call'
@CDexx gossips 'Free spellups (run) 2se of recall courtesy of clan Armchair Avenger (TM).  Please read "help dexx" for helpful hints.'
@CGritznakka gossips 'yea, but this game is probably worse then mmos as far as combat strategy, it's attack, use your best skill, and heal when necesary.'
@CDexx gossips 'Clan Armchair Avenger thanks you for your visit.  Have a muddish day.'
@CStarling gossips 'debuffs are more varied now, and there is open PK now as well'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Don't get me wrong I think it has it's place, you'll never find as close knit community as here on an mmo.'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Plus MUDs are always going to be more about the social aspect then the gameplay.'
@CFenix gossips 'i dunno. i think if the gameplay was bad i wouldnt stick around to chat.'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'same'
@CBrillig gossips 'this game is almost as good as candycrush'
@CGritznakka gossips 'I didn't say the gameplay was bad, I said the combat strategy couldn't compare'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Don't get me wrong I'm not getting down on this game'
@CGritznakka gossips 'But when my solution to leveling is find an area aoe rooms, then go make a sandwich, certainly the pve aspect isn't very interesting, and that's just a problem with the medium, not the game itself'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Visual MMos have the advantage of making you have to move and dodge during combat, something that wouldn't translate to text very well'
@CStarling gossips 'I like the problem solving aspect of the game, specifically problem solving via scripts'
@CStarling gossips 'I also like rioting and talking about ninjas.'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'and banning me'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Well, I will counter riot and talk about samurai!'
@CLoc gossips 'movement in MMOs? most of them you end up reduced to a rotation of skills one after the other.. it's hardly more involved than this.'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'waiting.'
@CGritznakka gossips 'I mean physical movement, if your playing a mmo where you just stand still during every fight, you're playing a bad mmo'
@CStarling gossips 'I liked the pvp in WoW, used to play a warlock and had all the epix and it was great.  Overpowered pvp class ftw.'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'waiting for starling to use the sban social on me'
@CGritznakka gossips 'I do want to reiterate again that I'm not trying to badmouth this game or even MUDs in general, was just trying to point out the difference.'
@C(Gossip) Razor wants to hear more about the AOE a room and leave the keyboard part.
@CGritznakka gossips 'I love you Razor/'
@CGritznakka gossips 'you can check my logs all day for botting if you want'
@CGritznakka gossips 'it was an exageration'
@CRazor gossips 'Wasn't planning to but good to have your permission, thanks.'
@C(Gossip) Taeryn thinks that you should have a wireless keyboard and aoe a room, then leave the monitor and take the keyboard so you have plausibility of saying you never left the keyboard.
@CRazor gossips 'Yeah that's the kind of logic that lead to S&D'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Lol'
@CRazor gossips 'no rules technically broken right?'
@CBrillig gossips 'what is aoe'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Area of Effect'
@CMendaloth gossips 'Age of Empires.  Decent strategy game.'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'o i c'
@CGritznakka gossips 'In terms off this game it's a spell the will hit the whole room'
@CMendaloth gossips 'Eventually if you get area attacks they'll show up in spells area.'
@CBrillig gossips 'i see, thx'
@CRazor gossips 'Btw, I was missing with you. Tend not to announce on gossip when seriously looking at someone for botting.'
@CRazor gossips 'sigh, messing ..'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'fire breath, ultrablast, death field, hand of justice, wrath of god, ice cloud, toxic cloud and hammerswing are some examples'
@CGritznakka gossips 'I know, sorry, I took it wrong'
@CMendaloth gossips 'You'll get earthquake as your first one Brillig.'
@CStarling gossips 'He really is a teddy bear at heart.'
@C(Gossip) Starling's shifty eyes dart back and forth.
@CGritznakka gossips 'Yea, I am...don't know about Razor'
@CBrillig gossips 'yes I do have earthquake. that explains why when i use it everyone starts attacking me'
@CRazor gossips 'Sheep in wolfs clothing.'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'wolf in sheep's clothing'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Sorry for that, I tend to treat you like I would treat my boss at work, if I'm accused of wrongdoing, I tend to not treat is as a joke.'
@CStarling gossips 'How's the night going, Razor?'
@CBamboo gossips '@wRazor is not accepting challenges.@w'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Because he's scared I'll challenge him!'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Nevermind the fact that I don't remember how to do that...'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'what's so bad about one loss?'
@CGritznakka gossips 'You have donated 460,000,000 gold and 232 qp to your clan. You have paid 101,427,769 in clan tax.'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Why don't I have more gold.... :P'
@CMaruxus gossips 'did you donate all of it before you left?'
@CTaeryn gossips 'Probably during the hiatus.'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Heh, I've be gone for at least 6 years, still 4th in donations to my clan'
@CStarling gossips 'ahh, it's so satisfying to finally vacuum out my laptop keyboard.  Amazing how much crap works its way in there :P'
@CRazor gossips 'Goign fine Starling, thanks for asking, trying to have multiple conversations at once so not ignoring anyone.'
@C(Gossip) Rumour perks up and stares intently at Gritznakka.
@CStarling gossips 'I understand, at least you can keep your tells and channels straight, unlike me ;)'
@C(Gossip) Reltubydoc's shifty eyes dart back and forth as he focuses on the kobold champion, devious thoughts filling his mind.
@CRumour gossips 'Nice to see you back, Gritz :)'
@CDexx gossips 'To honor the hardest working Aard immortal - offering free enchants (up to 5 items) for any T0-T2s who come 2se (of recall).  Please read "help dexx" for helpful hints.'

@CPutty gossips 'that's just a dirty rumour'
@C(Gossip) Rumour hugs Gritznakka.

@C(Gossip) Rumour bonks Putty on the head for being such an UTTER moron.
@C(Gossip) Gritznakka bonks Putty on the head for being such an UTTER moron.

@CGritznakka gossips 'Rumour drag me plz'
@C(Gossip) Rumour snickers softly.
@CCrimzon gossips 'to HELL'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'rumour is an immortal'
@CStarling gossips 'no, she is a moor cat'
@C(Gossip) Starling's shifty eyes dart back and forth.
@CDexx gossips '8 minutes left on enchanters focus'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Believe me I know who Rumour is, her aussie bum is going to marry me at some point.'
@CStarling gossips 'australia does mail order now?'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'have you even watched her videos?'
@C(Gossip) Starling slinks away
@C(Gossip) Rumour looks at Gritznakka and swoons in ecstasy.
@CGritznakka gossips 'Hey Dexx wanna spellup, I can spellup you up absolutly free'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Hey, Canada is bigger then Australia, who wouldn't want to live here.'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'if you are affended because I keep reference your channel, rumour, I'm sorry'
@CRumour gossips 'Canadians speak funny,..'
@CGorsk gossips 'we speak fine, thanks'
@CRumour gossips 'not offended at all :)'
@CStarling gossips 'hard to know what canadians are talking aboot'
@CRumour gossips 'it is there for all to watch'
@CGritznakka gossips ''Tis true, I've never called someone 'mate'
@C(Gossip) Rumour goes: "No worries, mate!"
@CGritznakka gossips 'And I've never warned someone about a dingo eating their baby....though maybe I'm just an ass.'
@C(Gossip) Rumour gasps in astonishment.
@CKobus gossips 'i find it highly unlikely that you are a donkey'
@CKobus gossips 'donkeys cant type, their hooves you see'
@CStarling gossips 'You haven't gotten to know him yet ;)'
@C(Gossip) Starling fluffles Gritznakka's fur mercilessly.
@C(Gossip) Reltubydoc is agreeing with that Kobus person again...
@CRumour gossips 'LOL'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Well, maybe I have a donkey sized keyboard, YOU CAN'T JUDGE ME, YOU DON'T KNOW MY LIFE!'
@CMaruxus gossips 'if apes can type with their minds then so can donkeys'
@CDexx gossips 'ending enchanting a bit early.  have a muddish night.'

@CKobus gossips 'that is plausible'
@CDexx gossips 'Free spellups (run) 2se of recall courtesy of clan Armchair Avenger (TM).  Please read "help dexx" for helpful hints.'
@C(Gossip) Rumour sits down and thinks deeply. 
@CReltubydoc gossips 'plus, donkey is not a playable race, even though there was once a meeme about me being killed by a flying donkey. I thought I'd change my title to, 'hates flying donkeys," '
@CKobus gossips 'donkey sized keyboard is literally the only thing that needs to be explained in that situation'

@CRumour gossips 'yeah, I really need to get back into that!'
@CMaruxus gossips 'is that a youtube thing?'
@CRumour gossips 'apologies to all'
@C(Gossip) Rumour nods.

@CReltubydoc gossips 'again, she's an immortal'
@CKobus gossips 'im not so sure about that either'
@CStarling gossips 'that doesn't mean a thing'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Well, she's only reached level 208, she needs to put some leveling effort in'

@GGritznakka questions 'What do you mean by "boosted"'
@GQuanthir answers 'I mean level boost. Is it possible in mud to boost level someone?'
@GGritznakka answers 'Still not sure what you mean, grouping has a level cap and it's allowed to spellup people.'
@GOrophangi questions 'are you refering to following someone who does all the kills so that the other player gets the xp?'
@GQuanthir answers 'I dont remember very good since it was 5 years ago but I think before someone was helped me to get levels fast. Yes exactly like that'
@GOrophangi questions 'I have done that in the past but like you I took a long break and just started playing again so not sure if it is still done here.'
@GCyrn answers 'As long as the two characters are within the same level range a much stronger character can help a weaker one by grouping and killing things, commonly level 201s will 'drag' people from level 186 to 200'
@GGritznakka answers 'It's possible, the group systems acts as it own monitor, if you can find someone 15 levels above you, then they can powerlevel you pretty quick.'
@GGritznakka answers 'Beyond 15 level difference you won't get exp.'
@GQuanthir answers 'I think my second class choice was wrong. I am having hard time for leveling, killing mobs. So I thinked that maybe someone could help me to get past this remort'
@GGritznakka answers 'It's not a bad choise'
@GGritznakka answers 'Focus int in your training, second mort is probably the hardest, I'd take a physical class aka thief/warrior as your third though.'
@GGorsk answers 'warrior'
@GQuanthir answers 'is it possible for me to change my second class?'
@GFiendish answers 'uhhhhh'
@GGritznakka answers 'No, you have to work through it, just remember leveling isn't a race, it's a grind'
@GKallaz answers 'yes at 201 when you remort you can change into a 3rd class'
@GGorsk answers 'that's not not quite accurate, kallaz'
@GGorsk answers 'oh, oops. misread that'
@GGorsk answers 'my bad. that's totally accurate'
@GGritznakka answers 'You just gotta push through the levels, focus your mage attributes, cleric will give you lots of spellups as well, you'll find it easier if you just think of it one level at a time.'
@GGritznakka answers 't0 is the hardest tier in the game, once you push through it, leveling becomes really simple'
@GKallaz answers 'no matter what your 2nd class is, its slightly easier than your first class since u get those skills back and gain some new skills. The first few classes of any tier are a bit slow'
@GQuanthir answers 'I remorted this char 5 years ago. So I probably thinked that two caster class would be good, less stat to focus on but that is not right. I should have choose warrior or thief'
@GGritznakka answers 'two casters work.'
@GCyrn answers 'no matter what you picked it would be slow, it's twice the xp as the first mort but not twice the power'

@GGritznakka answers 'Like I said those first morts in t0 suck, you're not going to have the power to overcome the extra tnl, but if you grind it out, it gets easier after t0'
@GQuanthir answers 'Yea. It is really frustrating. I am even thinking recreating another char :)'
@GPwar answers 'I am enjoying my t0'
@GPwar answers 'you guys are doing it wrong!!'

@C(Gossip) Feeling lonely and unwuved, Reltubydoc sits down and sucks on his toes.
@CMonst gossips 'its not a feeling bro. it is.'
@C(Gossip) Noegel consoles Reltubydoc. It is obvious that Noegel cares.
@CReltubydoc gossips 'I was just using the social t9 of the yeti race'
@C(Gossip) Monst hits Reltubydoc with a frypan. Pull yourself together!

@GAbelinc answers 'the aardwiki (help wiki) has an "areas" section with pages on each area. Maps made by many clans and players can be found for nearly all areas on the area pages :-)'
@GSletch answers 'yeah that's how i knew there was another side, i guess i'm just outta luck til someone else kills him and he repops over here?'
@GAbelinc answers 'nobody kills him the first time...you attack him in his lair, then he runs away to another room for you to go to him and really kill him...that's how you get to the other side'
@GAbelinc answers 'he's on the same side you're on'
@GAbelinc answers 'he doesn't go to the other side'

@GLanreth questions 'hey all, does a "daily blessing area reset token" just reset the mobs in an area?'
@GEscobar answers 'Yeah'
@GEscobar answers 'You're forcing the entire area to repop.'
@GEscobar answers 'So items respawn, too.'
@GLanreth answers 'are they worth keeping? do they sell well?'
@GEscobar answers 'They're owned to you, so you cannot sell them directly.'
@GAbelinc answers 'you can't sell them, because they're owned'
@GLanreth answers 'ahh ok'
@GEscobar answers 'You could sell their use, I guess'
@GAbelinc answers 'but you can sell "the use of them"...someone could pay you to run to an area and reset it for them'
@GLanreth answers 'yeah thats true'
@GAbelinc answers 'however, the use cases for that are pretty specific...the best way to use it yourself is in a GQ...but those happen too fast to contract someone to use a token for you, so it's mostly limited to either people pupping quickly, or someone trying to finish a campaign (or the occasionally griefing repop in a maze :P)'
@GLanreth answers 'yeah ill probably just use next time i need for a cp or quest mob'

@GZcrim questions 'just buy another dagger to wield and ignore the 40 for now?'
@GKash answers 'yea, starting at 80'
@GZcrim answers 'ah, maybe ill get buy duals for my higher levels'
@GKash answers 'weapons < 80 are usually reserved for when you have extra qps lying around or get them cheap on rauc'
@GXaxz answers 'Best to get them every 40 levels at first, then fill in between, then double up'
@G(Answer) Kash nods at Xaxz.
@CLady Charity@C says, @c"@CGreetings m'Lord .. welcome to Castle Levitus.@c"
@GZcrim answers 'ok maybe ill just double up my 80,100,120,140,160'
@GXaxz answers 'Do you have other gears yet?'
@GZcrim answers 'whats more important, double weps or aura, breastplate etc for higher lvls?'
@GZcrim answers 'i have helm, aura, breastplate,rings, boots at lvl 1'
@GXaxz answers 'You have a solid set of weapons for now.  I would get some other gears.  Level 100 BP is important'
@GHecklin questions 'ive browsed the help files, and havnt found much. is there a way to remove object flags? i.e. anti-good/evil?'
@GMaruxus answers 'tp'
@GZcrim answers 'ok, someone advised to get at 90 since you can use at lvl 1 T9, 100 more important stat wise?'
@GZcrim answers 'and yeah I used my aura and BP from lvl 1 to 201 last remort lol'
@GGrimvald answers 'help setflag, Hecklin'
@GDaak answers 'How soon you planning on being T9?'
@G(Answer) Maruxus nods at Daak.
@GXaxz answers 'Well it's a good idea to have some at a few levels.  Unless you plan to sit at level 1 as a T9 (probably won't) then it really doesn't matter.  Level 1-10 at T9 is a quick breeze'
@GZcrim answers 'nod, should i prioritize aura and BP this go around for lvl 100?'
@GZcrim answers 'I have rougly 7000 qps kicking'
@GMaruxus answers 'i would'
@GMaruxus answers 'unless you want to spend on xprate or stat reduction early'
@GMaruxus answers 'pretty close at 7k'
@GZcrim answers 'have xparate'
@GCaethorn answers 'wow'
@GXaxz answers 'Level 1 aura of sanc can get you by.  BP, Gloves, Bracers at 100 are really nice for the stats'
@GZcrim answers 'how can you appraise quest items?'
@GZcrim answers 'and thansk for your help!'
@GDaak answers 'at questor, q app item'
@GAnaristos answers 'at a questor use shop commands prefixed by quest: example quest list'
@GXaxz answers 'If you look at "help quest items" any item that has hit/dam /5 is good to get at 50, 100, 150 to start out.  The ones that don't, you can get by with level 1 of those items for quite some time'
@GZcrim answers 'ah, hense BP, Gloves and Bracers'
@GZcrim answers '100 is gonna be awesome :P'
@GXaxz answers 'However, to start out, level 100 of those will do you very well for the entire remort in general.  Wishes then become VERY important'
@GCaethorn answers 'thought you were supposed to get lvl 80....'
@GMaruxus answers 'for weapons'
@GCaethorn questions 'ok'
@GZcrim answers 'after xprate what is best qps spent for wishes?'
@GPutty answers 'depends what you want, portal, statcost, and spellup are top ones to me'
@GMaruxus answers 'imo probably stat reduction or maybe portal or spellup for mage'
@GXaxz answers 'It's hard to say exactly.  Statcost and xprate are the most important in my opinion'
@GZcrim answers 'I will likely go pwar next tier'
@GAnaristos answers 'there will be little argument if you choose spellup as your first wish.'
@GXaxz answers 'I certainly went with spellup as my first though.'
@GKash answers 'spellup wish will save you about 5 hours of spellup time over a tier'
@GAnaristos answers 'most people do'
@GZcrim answers 'spellups are meh, once they are on its not that important as I dont have that many spells to maintain...'
@GXaxz answers 'You will.'
@GKash answers '.... you have ALL the spells'
@GZcrim answers 'agreed, but I dont play on sitting'
@GKash answers 'once you hit 201'
@GAnaristos answers 'by the time you are an x7 you will be casting 63 to 65 spells per spellup plus 1 to 4 skills'
@GZcrim answers 'I just try and fly through while doing camp from 1-30ish'
@GAbelinc answers 'he already is an r7 ;-)'
@GZcrim answers 'i am x7'
@GAnaristos answers 'I see :) Well, if you don't mind watching paint dry then spellup wish is not for you :)'
@GDaak questions 'Kash, what's the same estimate fo xprate? heh'
@GXaxz answers 'If efficiency is at all a concern to you, spellups do take up a lot of your time.  And if you're not using them all, you are gimping yourself more than not choosing your aardeq well'
@GKash answers 'haha, 10% less time per tier?'
@GAbelinc answers 'tbh, once full-auto spellup scripts became legal, spellup wishes were less important...except when you die, you will very rarely be waiting for spells to cast'
@GXaeris answers 'Exprate does earn you a bonus 18 levels a mort'
@GKash answers 'depends how fast you are'
@GAnaristos answers 'right, for every spellup spell you miss you will get a thank you note from the mobs union.'
@GXaxz answers 'I'm with Abelinc on this one.  I would rate it #3 in the wish todo with either exprate or wishstat as #1/#2'
@GAnaristos answers 'and you can ignore their laughter :)'
@GZcrim answers 'wishstat? is that Stat red?'
@GMaruxus answers 'yep'
@GMaruxus answers 'reduces cost of training a stat'
@GZcrim answers '-1 to everything?'
@GXaxz answers 'Yes.  And even though it seems a mere -1 isn't a big deal, it's huge for your power creep'
@GAnaristos answers 'the point about spellup is that it is cheap as first, if you wait until you buy wishstat and exprate you will be paying an unwarranted premium.'
@GMaruxus answers 'one stat at a time'
@GXaxz answers 'Nope.  Just one stat.  But you only get -1 per tier'
@GXaeris answers 'I would put Spellup > exprate > duration > wishstat. Wishstat is really only highly useful for sitting/being at 201/training past 171.'
@GMaruxus answers '10k qp'
@GXaxz answers 'So it's like getting a free tier forward in stat cost'
@GZcrim answers 'ugh lol'

@Y(@WGroup@Y) @YOmerye: 'I have @G7 @gHeal @YPots @RLeft@Y! (@BPotion_Quaffer @RPlugin@Y)'
@GDaak questions 'Does xprate go ahead of things like level 1 aard gear, for newer players for most of you as well?'
@GXaxz answers 'I don't entirely agree with that Xaeris.  The increased power of wishstat (if you use it wisely) can be noticable at later levels for sure'
@GXaeris answers 'Aard gear > wishes to start, Daak.'
@GXaxz answers 'I don't personally rate level 1 aard gear nearly as important as it's made out.  A few items are nice, but the rest are mostly just little luxuries'
@GZcrim answers 'yeah I sat at one for a long time while I couldnt really play'
@GZcrim answers 'just did it because i could'
@GXaeris answers 'Xaxz - Not really. It saves you a maximum of 324 trains. Even at low tiers, it would net out to be maybe 100 trains (at most).'
@GXaeris answers 'So it's really only effective when you're sitting, to get the 324 train gain.'
@GDaak questions 'On a new character, how would you spend for first 30k QP?'
@GXaxz answers 'Ehh, I guess that's fair.  But 100 trains goes a long way.  lol'
@GXaeris answers 'Not really.'
@GXaeris answers 'Esp. for the actual qp cost.'
@GXaeris answers 'It is necessary - but only when you're up at 201.'
@GXaxz answers 'lol, maybe you're just spoiled and forget what it's like to be us weaklings.  Take everything we can get.  :P'
@GXaeris answers 'Naw, I did it during V1. Trust me, it's really low on it's ROI.'
@GXaeris answers 'Duration's a better investment over it early onl.'
@GXaxz answers 'Duration kinda fades out in usefulness once we have spellup scripts that maintain.'
@GXaeris answers 'Except the mana cost per minute decreases substantially, and suddenly mana pot consumption decreases.'
@GXaeris answers 'Also allows lucky casts to keep stats maxxed stay around longer.'
@GAnaristos answers 'I still like duration, it diminishes the chance a spell will fall off during combat'
@CHecklin gossips 'man im having horrible luck tonight, smhl'
@CMaruxus gossips 'ded?'
@CHecklin gossips 'indeed'
@GZcrim answers 'since you guys are giving out all this great advice, where do you spend TP's?'
@CAnaristos gossips 'in theroy, luck takes no adjectives, the result of a lucky event can, however.'
@GMaruxus answers 'my first tps were aura, sleeping bag, and now weapon mods'
@GXaeris answers 'trivia aura, possibly a sleeping bag.'
@CTaeryn gossips 'All hail the mighty entropy!'
@GZcrim answers 'when and why do you sleep?'
@CAnaristos gossips 'take if you had no luck you would never be involved in a random event.'
@CHecklin gossips 'so i just suck at playing tonight then lol'
@GXaxz answers 'Sleep saves a TON of mana pot if you can time it right'
@CAnaristos gossips 'now we are talking! :>'
@GXaxz answers 'Or all pots, for that matter'
@CHecklin gossips 'ah gotcha'
@GMaruxus answers 'i'll enter my amulet and sleep right before a tick while cp'ing'
@CHecklin gossips 'i agree totally'
@GZcrim answers 'for the amount of $$ you can make, pots seem like a joke on cost'
@CAnaristos gossips 'j/k about your play :)'
@GMaruxus answers 'to be fair, i don't use pots at all if i can help it, but thus assassin'
@CHecklin gossips 'lmao i know XD'

@CAnaristos gossips 'sorry Taeryn, I have no censure command, otherwise I would happily have granted you your wish and censured you.'
@CHecklin gossips 'wak'
@GXaxz answers 'There's still an investment (time and gold).  It all boils down to playstyle.  Some of us strive for max efficiency'
@CHecklin gossips 'oops'
@GMaruxus answers 'sounds like botting <.<'
@GXaxz answers '..yes.  I bot my sleep timer.  It knows when I'm not in combat and a tick is about to happen.'
@GZcrim answers 'lol, I am luck to get to play more than an hour or two straight, eff means jack to me :P'
@GXaxz answers 'One could argue that it would mean more to someone with limited playtime'
@GMaruxus answers 'playstyle thing, some people don't spend time min/maxxing, just want to play'

@C(Gossip) Maruxus peers intently at Taeryn.
@GXaxz answers 'But as a partial answer to your TP question, max tpenchanting your first level 100 weapon is a nice goal for TPs once you get the essentials'
@GZcrim answers 'I have aura, so maybe ill work on those next.'
@GXaxz answers 'Of course a level 100 will take you somewhere around 30-something TPs on average iirc'

@CGrilraald gossips 'usually i consider there by mistake when i accidently type co instead of ci (campaign info alias) to decide where to runto next'
@C(Gossip) @wTrurien excitedly tries to get you to play lasertag. Type "@Clasertag join@w"!
@COyxl gossips 'I'm still trying to figure potsearch out.. it doesn't seem to trigger on basic stuff like " potsearch health"  or w/e and when I use potsearch cure it randomly picks a cure, while when I select potsearch minor healing, it says there is no such thing'
@COyxl gossips 'pin short, I feel it's terribly scripted'
@CKitCarson gossips 'you need to name the spell yer looking for'
@COyxl gossips '...but why?'
@CKitCarson gossips 'for example potsearch cure light'
@COyxl gossips 'all but still, why? all pots have categories, why not just list them all in order of functionality?'
@CKitCarson gossips 'to be exact... and easier... you search 'health' and another person try 'life' and a third 'hp'... you see where this go ?'
@COyxl gossips 'I see three words that mean the same thiong, not hard to script either, ...it's not like muds don't have a huge load of pre-determined syntacix'
@COyxl gossips 'syntaxes/is/ys?'
@CValour gossips 'because potions have actual spells in it. To search what you need, you need to know the name of spell because potsearch searches the spells inside the potions '
@CFreddie gossips 'if it's any help potsearch black lotus wil get you manna...'
@COyxl gossips 'and no one thought to tag them with a category instead?'
@COyxl gossips 'let's face it, it's dumb :P there's very little in this mud that's dumb, but this is dumb'
@COyxl gossips 'whats the difference between a minor cure of lvl 1 and lvl 50?'
@CKitCarson gossips 'so 'potsearch protection' should list the 875 potions with 'protection' effects ? :) '
@CValour gossips 'that depends. If I search with health keyword t will also shows me light health potions as well as other lower potions. I will have to look for them all'
@COyxl gossips 'can I assume more, better? Why is there a minor/major (w/e) if cures of different levels provide different quantity of healing'
@COyxl gossips 'valour, protection what?'
@COyxl gossips 'just because you couldn't get beyond protection, doesn't mean that you couldn't list protection types that exist when querying'
@CKitCarson gossips 'oxyl: 'help cure light''
@CValour gossips 'if you know the spells, then you know the which potion you are looking for. That was enough until now. And I believe it is still enough for most of the players.'
@COyxl gossips 'I have never used the help function before (that was sarcasm), tell me what I'm looking at that makes this all more cler'
@COyxl gossips 'it's fine because people apparently learned to live with it, I find it terribly convoluted and archeic'
@COyxl gossips 'and my spelling terrible /shrug'
@CKitCarson gossips ''primary stat: Wisdom     affected by: None''
@COyxl gossips 'so again, what's the difference between a cure light of lvl 1 and lvl 50?'
@CValour gossips 'I don't even know which benefits will you gain when you search with category. There is too much protection spells for example. And some of potions have several spells in it'
@CKitCarson gossips 'none'
@COyxl gossips 'so why suggest they exist by selling them at different levels?'
@COyxl gossips 'valour I think I just replied to your protection example, scroll up'
@CKitCarson gossips 'usually the higher lvls have more spells in it'
@COyxl gossips 'more of the same spell I assume'
@CKitCarson gossips 'besides maybe (MAYBE.... I'm a total noob here) 20 years ago there was a difference'
@CNchant gossips 'a lot of things have changed in 20 years'
@CKitCarson gossips 'could even be different spells...'
@COyxl gossips 'not ignoring that fact, but imho, this could use some change :P'
@CValour gossips 'you can note to imms about that and see what they will tell you'
@COyxl gossips 'well, I'm guessing I'm not the first, so thats probably pointless and it might require some rework on spells to begin with, which might be a tad too big, but sometimes you just want to facedesk'
@CMurtagh gossips 'my char is stupidly op'
@CMurtagh gossips 'Mobs that consider tells me to run from I kill easily'
@CMurtagh gossips 'is that a flaw in the consider system?'
@CValour gossips 'No it tells you depending on level difference.'
@CKitCarson gossips 'help consider... it's merely lvl based, but mobs you fight at your asctual lvl dont have all your equip :)'
@CMurtagh gossips 'that makes sense'
@CKitCarson gossips 'dont worry, yopu'll have plenty of occasions to die :)'
@CMurtagh gossips 'already happened once XP'
@CGrilraald gossips 'i very rarely use consider for anything, as i was relatibely easily crushing 'mobs that would crush me like a bug' like a bug. quickest way of judging if i can kill something or not is to just try. soon find out one way or other'
@CValour gossips 'dont forget, you can always try to 'flee' if the mob too strong for you'
@CKitCarson gossips 'when I'm exploring new areas, consider is a good indicator if I'm going too deep into them'

@GMaruxus answers 'aram hardcore you only live once'
@GAnaristos answers 'that is an intersting take on interpretation. You are saying you interpreted their statement in such a way and when someone else interprets it another way you say they are wrong as if interpretations were laws of nature. Interpretaion is a form of judgement and judgements are as personal as you can get.'
@GXaxz answers 'I only suggested that you were wrong when you started suggesting everyone else was wrong to think anything but your interpretation.'
@G(Answer) Arrdwolf snickers softly.
@GXaxz answers 'But anyway, off to the debate channel amirite'
@GMaruxus answers 'need a set of debate clubs'
@GAnaristos answers 'no, I never implied that anyone else was wrong, I was just telling how I interpreted his question as a justification for the answer I gave.'
@GRedryn questions 'are these still questions and answers?'
@G(Answer) Kaparintine shows some interest in what is being talked about since what is happening doesn't typically occur in question-answer channel

@GMaruxus answers 'no'
@GKaparintine questions 'what is actually being discussed here that is unrelated to the general system of this channel?'
@GMaruxus answers 'linguistical debates...not entirely anomalous'
@CKaparintine gossips 'If it actually is a debate, it definitely should go to the debate channel, unless there is a good reason for it not to be there'
@CHecklin gossips '/agreed'
@CAnaristos gossips 'there is no debate channel.'
@GKaparintine answers 'If it actually is a debate, it definitely should go to the debate channel, unless there is a good reason for it not to be there'
@CMaruxus gossips 'nope'
@GIambigous questions 'what if it's just a contradiction?'
@CKaparintine gossips 'Wait, the debate channel disappeared?'
@CHecklin gossips 'the fact i can just cutthe channel off is pretty sweer too XD'
@CDurel gossips 'debate channel was removed'
@CArrdwolf gossips 'anaristos removed it!'
@CHecklin gossips 'err sweet'
@C(Gossip) Arrdwolf falls to the ground and rolls around, laughing hysterically.
@CKash gossips 'yea its a good thing the always-off channel... err "debate" doesnt exist any more. otherwise we might have a space for these meaningless topics to take place!'
@CMaruxus gossips 'i did always have to turn it off'
@CHecklin gossips 'lmao nice'
@CMaruxus gossips 'too bad people don't know debate rules'
@GXaxz questions 'If I phrase everything I want to put here as a question, does it deserve to stay?  And if folks respond in answer, shouldn't the conversation be allowed to be in these channels?'
@CAnaristos gossips 'that's debatable'
@GMaruxus answers 'good questions ^.^'
@CKash gossips 'take it to debate! :p'
@CArrdwolf gossips '/agree'
@GAnaristos answers 'I apologize for going overboard with the topic, let's let it end.'
@CIambigous gossips 'that's debateable'
@GXaxz answers 'Sadly, the answer is no.  The helpfile says it has to be mud-related.  :('
@CKash gossips 'oh god...'
@CArrdwolf gossips 'that's what she said'
@CKaparintine gossips 'Does anyone know why Debate channel disappeared? That's really frustrating that it's gone since I thought it's a pretty relevant channel in day-to-day circumstances.'
@CMaruxus gossips 'lol...can you even imagine?'
@CMaruxus gossips 'always-off indeed'
@CKash gossips 'it was removed with a bunch of other unneeded channels'
@CGorsk gossips 'cause people would go there to swear and spam and everyone else had it off'
@CRedryn gossips 'i think it was a move to reduce the number of channels'
@CRedryn gossips 'cos lots of channels were toggled off, and that reduced player interaction'
@CKaparintine gossips 'Oh okay.'
@CKash gossips 'wrongfully, imo'
@CArrdwolf gossips 'which other channels were removed?'
@CImpurifan gossips 'u can deb channel here'
@CArrdwolf gossips 'I only recall debate being removed'
@CKash gossips 'hrm idk there are notes about it'
@CKaparintine gossips 'Maybe Debate channel could be moderated so that ridiculous debates wouldn't happen; in other words, only productive debates would happen more or less.'
@CKash gossips 'somewheres'
@CAnaristos gossips 'nobletalk was also removed.'
@CArrdwolf gossips 'no others were removed that's why'
@wHecklin grats 'Grats!'
@CMaruxus gossips 'who even used that one?'
@CKaparintine gossips 'I personally think we need a debate channel lol.'
@CKash gossips 'mxit was removed as well'

@CAnaristos gossips 'well, when i was a newbie and thereabouts it used to be used a lot, since the player population has declined many channels have gone into disuse.'
@CGorsk gossips 'curse can double as debate. same thing, really'
@CKash gossips 'uhm no its not, curse is NOT debate'
@CKash gossips 'debate contained meaningless garbage that 2 people cared about, only one person needs to care on curse'
@CKaparintine gossips 'Lol, yes, if I was around enough, I would be moderator, Maruxus lol'
@CGorsk gossips 'not the name of the channels, but it is in the way they're used'
@CAnaristos gossips 'it would be possible to conduct a debate on the curse channel, but debate and curse were governed by different rules so the integrity of the dabate can't be assured and can't be demanded.'
@CGorsk gossips 'curse/debate= angry people swearing at each other'
@CKash gossips 'nah gorsk, curse channel is angry people swearing at nothing about 90% of the time'
@CAnaristos gossips 'while it was true that debate was curse-allowed, the cursing was relatively infriquent.'
@CHenry@C says, @c"@CI wish I was a janitor, but no! My son, the mayor, said it would look bad for him to get me a government job.@c"
@CGorsk gossips 'maybe i'd toggle it on at the wrong times...'
@CAnaristos gossips 'I spent some enjoyable times on debate but there were times when I would turn it off :)'
@CPwar gossips 'use of swear words really just means you're too lazy to formlate an actual thought and turn it into meaningful words'
@CAphelion gossips 'I suppose roleplay could be used as a debate platform, but I am not sure curse is allowed.'
@CPwar gossips 'formulate*'
@CMaruxus gossips 'it's a lizard thing, sometimes you  can'at help it'
@CMaruxus gossips 'like get hit in the thumb with a hammer and tell me you won't cuss'
@CKash gossips 'curse isnt allowed on roleplay'
@CPwar gossips 'what does cussing about smashing your finger do for you'
@CGorsk gossips 'people actually have that channel on...? :)'
@CMaruxus gossips 'releases endorphins and seratonin oddly enough'
@CPwar gossips 'ahh so the words are magic..'
@CPwar gossips 'goodnight all :P'

@CArrdwolf gossips 'no a mummy is a preserved corpse'
@CYou gossip 'can't tell if that was serious or what'
@CArrdwolf gossips 'yes serious'
@CStarling gossips 'Does that mean your mom is a preserved corpse?'
@CStarling gossips 'By the previous logic I suppose it could?'
@C(Gossip) Starling walks around in the room, looking very confused.
@CArrdwolf gossips 'in egypt a mummy is a preserved corpse'
@C(Gossip) You look at a howling aardwolf ponderingly.
@CArrdwolf gossips 'it's a process where-by the egyyptians coat the corpse in a special preservative'
@CBrillig gossips 'all corpses had a mum at some point'
@CArrdwolf gossips 'then wrap it in bog roll!'
@CStarling gossips 'Sodium chloride and sodium carbonate'
@C(Gossip) Arrdwolf falls to the ground and rolls around, laughing hysterically.
@CBrillig gossips 'and to painstakingly preserve a corpse...only a mother's love could inspire that'
@CYou gossip 'I think we need to teach aardwolf what puns are, even if they were terribly made '
@CBrillig gossips 'i am opun to that idea'
@CArrdwolf gossips 'no sodium chloride is corrosive starling'
@CArrdwolf gossips '(salt)'
@CArrdwolf gossips 'it's how they used to preserve beef in the navy during wartimes'
@CArrdwolf gossips 'it would preserve it and cook it'
@CArrdwolf gossips 'but left for too long it would corode it'
@CArrdwolf gossips 'salt in wound hurts because effectively it's cooking your flesh'

@CArrdwolf gossips 'this is my point'
@CBrillig gossips 'that's why when you get electrocuted..it's the same as eating french fries'
@CArrdwolf gossips 'idk how they preserve mummys in egypt but I'm sure it can't be sodium chloride'
@CTrachx gossips 'salt preserves (I guess by dehydration) and could be considered anti-bio (I mean anti bacterial)'
@C(Gossip) Gorsk whispers, "This is going to sting a little," as he pours boiling hot salt water into your open wound.

@C(Gossip) Noegel crosses her arms and nods slowly and sagely to Trachx.
@CArrdwolf gossips 'if that's a strong motto then perhaps keep your opinions to yourself as it's likely not many will agree'
@CStarling gossips 'Jesus speaks only the truth!'
@CNoegel gossips 'Jesus died a long time ago.'
@CAnaristos gossips 'Aarwolf, you have a problem with me post a note.'

@CYou say 'weapon'
@CThe blacksmith@C asks, @c"@C'Eh? What is that you say? A weapon?@c"
@CThe blacksmith@C says, @c"@CThere is a tale, once told, of a magical blade that was broken into 5 pieces. It is, or was, the only weapon known to defeat the champion.@c"
@CThe blacksmith@C says, @c"@CThe current champion of the arena had five friends, brothers and sisters of the sword, and they all took a piece of the sword to keep it safe. This guaranteed that he would never lose another battle.@c"
@CThe blacksmith@C says, @c"@CHe has been the champion for so long now, longer than most of the crowd can remember. The fights have become boring and stale, and the crowds come less often to see the fights.@c"
@CThe blacksmith@C says, @c"@CThe pieces of the blade are scattered and kept hidden, and only by defeating his friends can you win the pieces of the sword. Do not underestimate them though, as they are champions in their own right and have yet to be bested in a duel.@c"
@CThe blacksmith@C says, @c"@CIf you can bring me these broken pieces I should be able to forge them into a blade that will defeat the current champion and bring some life back to the tournament again.@c"
@CThe Champion of the Fields@C says, @c"@CWho are you to challenge me? I shall appreciate the sound of my arrows thudding into your skin.@c"

@CThe blacksmith@C says, @c"@CWho'da thought! Well done, I really didn't think ya had it in you.@c"
@CThe blacksmith@C says, @c"@COh, aye! I can reforge these for you, but the problem now is the hilt. I have nothing that will match the strength and size of this particular weapon. I am not sure where you can go for this one. Perhaps master Tarob will know, he's the one running the fights.@c"
@CThe blacksmith@C says, @c"@CYou need to watch your back, though, you have caused quite a stir amongst the peasants, killing off the champions to get their pieces of the blade. Really would have been better if you had'da done it more civil like.@c"
@CThe blacksmith@C says, @c"@CCome back to me when you find the hilt that matches this sword and I shall forge you a sword worthy of a champion.@c"
@CYou say 'hilt'
@CTarob@C asks, @c"@CAhh, the old sword of champions. So you found the missing pieces of the blade, did you?@c"
@CTarob@C says, @c"@CI may have an idea on where to find this hilt that you need, and it sure would be nice to announce a winner other than the current champion for a change. Mind you, all fights need to be fair! Still, you will need strength, courage and skill to beat one so formidable, even with the sword reforged.@c"
@C(Gossip) Valour claps at Reltubydoc's performance.
@CTarob@C says, @c"@CI have heard whisperings of a plot to overrun the fortress. To what purpose yet I do not know, nor do I know exactly who is involved. I have seen a messenger coming and going a lot lately and fear he may be carrying messages of sedition.@c"
@CTarob@C says, @c"@CI need to know what messages he carries and I can't personally get involved. If you could step in and bring to me any messages pertaining to this plot, I will be most grateful. Go now, and on your return I should have the information you need. Leave me now.@c"

@CA messenger@C says, @c"@COh, that really wasn't fair now.@c"
@CTarob@C says, @c"@CAhh, I see you have the message, but, as you can plainly see, it is too late.@c"
@CTarob@C says, @c"@CThe peasants stormed the fortress while you were gone, overrunning it completely. They broke in here and stole the map I had, one that promised to show the way to the hilt. I don't think they looked too kindly on the wanton slaughter of their champions and they have done this to stop you from challenging the tournament champion, I am sure of it.@c"
@CTarob@C says, @c"@CSome people do not look to change and prefer things stay as they are. I do not know where they have taken the map to, but if you start to the south of the village and put the terror of your sword to them, I am sure you will find your way to it.@c"
@CTarob@C says, @c"@CGood luck, and Ayla speed you. Come back to me when you have what is needed to get this fight started.@c"
@CA vampire@C exclaims, @c"@CFine, take the map, but don't expect to be able to locate that hilt. You'll need to get to the right co-ordinates, which won't be easy unless you know what you're doing!@c"

But fer all that, he's the best bit of law we've got around here, and he generally kept things quiet like until his brother Jake came back into town.@c"

@CYou say 'jumpsteady is alone'

I just so happen to know he is flat broke so he won't be going out to the secret tables. Perhaps you can go and stimulate his income with this and clear the way for Ivar's safety. Of course as always you can get another bond by saying so.@c"

@CJumpsteady the Thief@C says, @c"@COh yes, the key. Well you see that is going to be tricky. Zayne has the key, and he surely isn't going to just give it to you. Besides even if you got to him, anyone who enters the keep without the favor of Damian is detected via dark magic. One thing is for certain. If you are to get anywhere near the key, you will have to gain the favor of Damian.@c"

I have lost many loved ones during our time here, such as my dear sister Mibella.@c"
@CVaida, the Caravan Matron@C says, @c"@CMibella was always a curious young woman and would venture throughout the Killing Fields just getting to know our surroundings. One day when she dared to cross over beyond the great gates, she fell off the bridge into the river of magma.

@CVaida, the Caravan Matron@C says, @c"@CThank you, Omerye, for returning this to me. Now I shall help you as best as I can. Some of the corrupted Humans that work for Damian frequently indulge themselves on our unwilling gypsy women. One such man worked for Damian as an executioner. His mask was left behind. I believe this mask will not only shroud your good nature, but will help you in your journey by convincing them that you just might be on their side.@c"
@GNchant questions 'how do i place bet in prosper?'
@GDaak questions 'Yes, but apparently good enough for the guard to TAKE as he does the fake one'

@CYou say 'key'
@CZayne the Magician@C says, @c"@CAhh, so it is finally time to execute that miserable human. I have been waiting a while for such a grand event. I only wish I could be there in person. Here take this key and lead him to the gallows. Bring me back some of his flesh if you can.@c"
@CThe Wraith@C exclaims 'Hello, traveler!'
@CJumpsteady the Thief@C says, @c"@CAh, Omerye.  I hope you have been successful.@c"
@CJumpsteady the Thief@C says, @c"@CI have been receiving messages from Rude Boy. His notes tell me that he has found a way to infiltrate Damian's keep. He has direct knowledge on how to get to Damian himself, the only problem is, he is far too powerful for any of us to defeat. Go and find Rude Boy and see what his plans are and assist in any way you can.@c"
@CThe Wraith@C exclaims 'Hello, traveler!'
@GTeleron answers 'I'll try it with mine, which guard was it?'
@CThe Rude Boy@C asks, @c"@CYou again, I remember you! Are you here to actually help this time?@c"
@CYou say 'yes'
@CThe Rude Boy@C says, @c"@CGood, this is your chance to make things right. I have learned exactly who it was who sent the petal from the actual Dark Lotus to Jumpsteady. It was the Spirit of the Lotus itself. What a powerful force indeed. In fact the Spirit of the Lotus is here within the dreaded Killing Fields. Seek him out and do what it takes to acquire the power of the Dark Lotus Blossom. He should answer if you mention what it is you are looking for.@c"
@CThe Wraith@C exclaims 'Hello, traveler!'
@CYou say 'dark lotus'
@CThe Wraith@C says, @c"@CDark Lotus indeed. I am not surprised that you have found my true identity.  I am however surprised that it has taken this long. You seek the very power that I have been watching over for centuries.@c"
@CThe Wraith@C says, @c"@CIt wasn't always like this. At one time The Dark Lotus was split into six petals and protected by six followers of the Lotus. Like most secret societies they adopted the name of the object they were protecting and thus became known as Dark Lotus.@c"
@CThe Wraith@C says, @c"@CWhen Damian was banished by Dark Lotus each of them gave up their power and the Dark Lotus Petals were reunited. Now that Damian has returned I am afraid the ultimate sacrifice will be needed. The Dark Lotus Blossom must be used to destroy Damian for good. I would entrust you with the Blossom now but your track record has not been so good in the past.@c"
@CThe Wraith@C says, @c"@CIf you were to prove to me how serious you are about actually helping then I would be a little more trusting.@c"
@CThe Wraith@C says, @c"@CDamian's Keep is nothing more than a museum of souls he keeps imprisoned. Some of the souls might just as well be for show; others are enchanted with powerful magics to detect the presence of the Dark Lotus Blossom.@c"
@GDaak questions '2nd one, asks for passport'
@CThe Wraith@C says, @c"@CThe Blossom must be able to be carried to Damian undetected or he will have time to evade our attempts. You will have to listen carefully to my instructions. One wrong move and our salvation will be lost and in the wrong hands the Dark Lotus Blossom is just as capable to be used as a tool of domination as it is a weapon against evil.@c"
@CThe Wraith@C says, @c"@CYou will need to free the Living Armor, The Hydra, The Undead Priest, The Earth Golem, and The Sacrificed Virgin. Once each of them is free, come back to me and tell me they are free.@c"
@GSnooky questions 'How do I see who is on a Gquest?'
@CThe Wraith@C exclaims 'Hello, traveler!'
@GDaak answers 'gq prog'
@GTeleron answers 'Confirmed, it does take your portal.'
@CThe Living Armor@C says, @c"@CI am cursed to forever serve Damian because the magic that enchants me can only be dispelled by an Elven Ghost. You could possibly contact an Elven Ghost if you speak of secrets at their final resting place. If you should summon the ghost, you could tell her about me.@c"
@CThe Hydra@C says, @c"@CI have been trapped here for such a long time I have lost track. All I want is to finally escape and be free. I would do it myself but the trenches are blocked by old bars on either side where the water flows. If only someone could remove the bars then I would finally be free.@c"
@GXaxz answers 'Is it an immune mob?  Or can you attack it?'
@GTeleron answers 'We both need to post it on the bugs board'
@CThe Undead Priest@C says, @c"@CI know why you are here Omerye, but I cannot relinquish my post as I am the last hope for a lot of people who are unfamiliar with the traps and pure evil within these halls. If someone was to make this place safe, at least from the traps, then perhaps I can finally leave with a clean conscience. Bring back proof of the traps being broken and we can work something out.@c"
@CThe Earth Golem@C asks, @c"@CBeing the largest of the corrupted, you'd think I could just bust my way out of here. Yet the reality is, I am just too brittle and dry to pull off anything like that.  But the cracks in the floor are separated just enough that if only I were to have a way to become a Mud Golem, I could finally be free of this torturous place. Can you find some water to pour here?@c"
@GDaak answers 'Can be attacked'
@GPleiades answers 'the academy is a good place to start and learn the game, snooky'
@GDaak answers 'Ok'
@GXaxz answers 'Just immune to physical maybe?'
@CA Sacrificed Virgin@C says, @c"@CI know why you are here, adventurer, and I am afraid that it is too late. I am already dead, so you can not marry and deflower me.@c"
@CA Sacrificed Virgin@C says, @c"@CI led such an unfulfilled, dull life.  When I was eight years of age, I was sent to dance school...@c"
@CA Sacrificed Virgin@C asks, @c"@CHey I know! Maybe you could check on my cat? Maybe pet him?@c"
@GDaak answers 'immune to physical and magic'
@GTeleron answers 'It sent me into the castle right away.'
@CThe Living Armor@C says, @c"@CI am cursed to forever serve Damian because the magic that enchants me can only be dispelled by an Elven Ghost.

@CYou say 'living armor'
@CThe Ghost of an Elf Named Kilisanth@C says, @c"@CMy husband wore that armor proudly into battle. Yet he was not strong enough to stop Damian. Now he is cursed to forever inhabit the Keep of that fiend.@c"
@CThe Ghost of an Elf Named Kilisanth@C says, @c"@CThe curse put upon him is pretty complex but a simple spell will remove it. Sadly we had no children. All our friends died, and our families murdered. All you have to do is convince him that he was once Jonathan Genji and the curse should weaken enough to be broken. Take this. Give this to him and remind him of my name. If that doesn't work, then nothing will.@c"

@CThe Wraith@C exclaims 'Hello, traveler!'
@CYou say 'they are free'
@CThe Wraith@C says, @c"@CI am seriously impressed with your dedication and will. You have truly proven yourself worthy for this task. Now I need you to clean out the souls that are far too dangerous to be just freed. They are too vile for this world.  Destroy the Magma Wyrm, the Doppelganger, the Archangel, and the Pale Rider. Once you have defeated all of them, return to me and tell me you have finished.@c"
@CThe Wraith@C exclaims 'Hello, traveler!'
@CYou say 'i have finished'
@CThe Wraith@C says, @c"@CI have sensed this moment for some time now. It is finally time to risk it all and to rid this world of Damian and his minions. I shall now give you the sacred Dark Lotus. Be sure to take this back to the one you call Rude Boy.@c"
@CThe Rude Boy@C asks, @c"@CYou again, I remember you! Are you here to actually help this time?@c"
@CThe Rude Boy@C says, @c"@CThis, this... this is the Dark Lotus. This is the key to destroying Damian once and for all. We have to get this to Jumpsteady. Come with me.@c"
@CJumpsteady the Thief@C says, @c"@CFinally we have the sacred lotus. This is quite magical as it can be used in many ways. It is mostly known for its destructive past. Yet today we will change all that.@c"
@CJumpsteady the Thief@C says, @c"@CIf you are ready, I think I can get you into the inner sanctum. You will have to use the Lotus to truly finish off the elite guard and even Damian himself. Just let me see you wear the Lotus and say yes, you are ready.@c"
@CYou say 'yes'
@CJumpsteady the Thief@C says, @c"@CAs soon as this hole is open enough, jump in. We will head out and bring the fight to the outer keep as a distraction.@c"
@CA little boy@C asks, @c"@CPlease, Omerye, help me. The big bad demon man is going to be back soon.  Please I beg you, help me, well? Will you say Yes?@c"
@CYou say 'yes'
@CA little boy@C says, @c"@CHa Ha you fool. You have lost your chance at winning. With this I could easily destroy you and anyone else who gets in my way. Yet... if I destroyed it, I would be virtually unstoppable. Yeah that's it. I will destroy this and be rid of it once and for all.@c"
@CYou say 'I have failed'
@CJumpsteady the Thief@C asks, @c"@CWhat happened to the Dark Lotus?@c"
@CJumpsteady the Thief@C says, @c"@CI have no idea what in the world we are going to do now. This is disastrous. All is once again doomed thanks to your lack of success. I know one thing- I am not going to tell The Wraith what happened. You will have to tell him that you failed, yourself.@c"
@CThe Wraith@C exclaims 'Hello, traveler!'
@CYou say 'i have failed'
@CThe Wraith@C says, @c"@CThis is bad indeed. Yet there is still one tiny hope we can cling onto. Explorers have been searching the vast reaches of The Uncharted Oceans and may have found a place long forgotten. We have no way to confirm this yet, but when we do you will surely know.@c"
@CThe Wraith@C says, @c"@CWhy is this important you ask? The place in question is called The Nyne Woods. The Nyne are a race of centaurs that have played a part in this battle in centuries past. After the first time Damian was banished the Nyne had a falling out with the Thieves Guild.@c"
@CThe Wraith@C says, @c"@CSo the Nyne sealed off their great forest from all mortals. Yet before they did, they invited the six original keepers of the lotus petals; the cult of Dark Lotus. If you were able to get there and reunite Dark Lotus, they could show you how to replant the seed and possibly regrow The Dark Lotus.@c"
@CThe Wraith@C says, @c"@CMany powerful realms are said to be kept behind magical wards in an ancient temple within the Nyne Woods. Go forth and prepare yourself, you will need all the training you can to survive your next test. Perhaps this may help you on your way.@c"

@GDemacia questions 'also, is there a way to show a mobs raw HP, rather than percentage'
@CGritznakka gossips 'So, you can set an aardweapon to punch...actually pretty sure I have one set to punch.'
@GAbelinc answers 'no, because without interrogate, you wouldn't know it'
@CGorsk gossips 'you can but i haven't'

You stepped into the shadows! What you gonna do? I'm a lower level, but I'm a still kill you!'
@CStarling gossips 'there is no reason it should be.  There are 7 other bashing damage verbs, and also, if punch weren't a weapon damtype it would be easier to track actual offhand punch / unarmed damage versus with weapon.'
@CGritznakka gossips 'yea, I was blind, so I can neither confirm nor deny that you were unarmed, so we're going to spread the rumour that you weren't good enough to kill me using you best weapons in 1 round'

@GAnaristos answers 'I've known of people who have developed scripts to produce a surprisingly accurate value for mob total hp.'

@GAbelinc answers 'only after-the-fact'
@GAbelinc answers 'and MOB HP changes over time'
@YFenix barters:@w cheap turkey bid 380
@GStarling answers 'it's easy, Anaristos'
@GAnaristos answers 'true, after the fact but that's good enough for next time since it will be in the same range for the same mob.'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Which was probably unnecesary since I went to sleep at your feet'
@GStarling answers 'You track all damage you've done to the mob and divide by (1 - the mob's remaining health percent)'
@CGorsk gossips 'it was all unnecessary'

@GAbelinc answers 'watchmen used to have a public one, not sure if he's still there'
@GStarling answers 'also in watchmen and other clan halls'
@GStarling answers 'he is'
@GAnaristos answers 'yeah, near the entrance to Bad Trip'
@GStarling answers 'GW's lapdog'
@GStarling answers 'I wish there were a level 200 punchingbag though.'
@CGritznakka gossips 'In fact I only went to sleep because I was to poor to afford potions, and was just trying to regenerate@-'
@GAnaristos answers 'what for, a punching bag fights as if it were SH :)'
@GAbelinc answers 'then they wouldn't be punching bags, cuz they'd be hitting back'
@CHecklin gossips 'lava guards, sandstone block, bloodstone gauntlets, sold pleated schenti in donation (non-chanted L41)'
@G(Answer) Anaristos rapidly nods twice, in complete agreement.
@GStarling answers 'I imagine you could set their damage to 0'
@CGritznakka gossips 'If you really think about it, and squint really hard, this is really an underdog story'
@GAnaristos answers 'sure, but what would be the fun in that? :)'
@GStarling answers 'Testing'
@GAnaristos answers 'test on the test port :)'
@CGritznakka gossips 'To bad Anaristos isn't a part of it'
@CAnaristos gossips 'you still at it? :)'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Still at what?'
@GStarling answers 'the problem with hitting a level 1 punchingbag when you're SH is that the damage multiplier is an additional factor that needs to be dealt with'
@GAbelinc answers 'note that punching bag MOBs do have resists and vulns, so you should interrogate immediately before testing if comparing different-damtype stuff'
@CThe steward@C exclaims 'Hello, my lord! Enjoy the wedding celebration!'
@GNoegel answers 'can I be a punching bag plz k thx bye'
@GStarling answers 'You can actually measure the relative resistances with a damage tracker and changing flag weapon'
@GAbelinc answers 'no, that's gritz's job'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Hey sometimes I talk to myself, at least in this case I can pretend people are listening.'
@G(Answer) Noegel wails miserably.
@GGritznakka answers 'Come at me bro'
@CAnaristos gossips 'we are listening, Gritz. At least Abe is :)'
@CStarling gossips 'this is all a bad acid trip'
@CGritznakka gossips 'yea, but abe wouldn't be fun to fight'
@CStarling gossips 'none of it is real.'
@CKicks gossips 'life is a lie, wake up.'
@CFenix gossips 'you cant, were stuck in the matrix.'
@GAbelinc answers 'the resistances randomize on load, and by the time you have any statistically-meaningful test with an unpredictable changing weapon, you've wasted an hour'
@CAnaristos gossips 'please we've banned existentialism from the gossip channel.'
@GStarling answers 'it doesn't take an hour'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Life is REAL!'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Sadly'
@CKicks gossips 'xD'
@GAbelinc answers 'it does to get meaningful data'
@GAbelinc answers 'and that's just the calibration before the test starts'
@GStarling answers 'few minutes at most.  Yes, to nail down that the mob is 25% resistant to X damtype might need a big sample, but it's readily apparent if the mob is resistant to X versus Y'
@CAnaristos gossips 'fortune is so colorful :)'
@GAbelinc answers 'few minutes you'd only hit with given damtypes a couple times each...the difference between a bad hit and a good hit is way more than resistance modifier...'
@GStarling answers 'works on normal mobs too but unfortunately they tend to die too quickly'
@GAnaristos answers 'bummer'
@GAbelinc answers 'so no, you cannot get a feel for resist x vs y in a few minutes'
@GStarling answers 'I use a limited damage range weapon to reduce the number of possible sample values'
@GStarling answers 'with a 200 aardweapon it could quite literally take an hour to get even a rough picture'
@GAnaristos answers 'I haven't seen one technical paper come out of this yet. Publish or perish, ladies and gentlemen!'
@GStarling answers 'with a level 27 weapon there are only a few dozen possible numbers so the rough picture is fairly easy to obtain'
@GYou answer 'this is a world governed by very precise rules. it's not physics. '
@GYou answer 'just bribe someone with the aardwolf repo '
@G(Answer) Have you got something in your eye?
@GAbelinc answers 'physics is governed by very precise rules'
@GStarling answers 'the low damage weapon lets the mob live longer too, so easier to get more samples and/or heal it'
@GYou answer 'a very large amount of very precise rules'
@GYou answer 'diku mud code is pretty small in comparrison'
@GYou answer 'even if we are not technically diku mud anymore'
@GAbelinc answers 'there's no diku mud code here...'
@GAbelinc answers 'not technically, untechnically, or in any other way...'
@GYou answer 'I'm not sure of the state of the current repo, but this was certainly derived from diku. In fact many of the methods, spells, prompts, items, and even areas are the same as any diku mud still around.'
@GYou answer 'that's pretty technical'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'is it normal for a level 1 to be doing 70 damage per weapon attack'

@GAbelinc answers 'isn't'
@GSnooky questions 'why is boot an imm run clan? that didnt last long'
@GXaxz answers 'It lasted for years...'
@GAphelion answers 'the original wonder woman it was, I am sure they have change the cannon by now. But if you look at the early comics her mother was the Queen of Lesbos.'
@GAbelinc answers 'it's still here...'
@GXaxz answers 'I meant as a non-imm-run clan'
@GAnaristos answers 'Boot is the most active clan here and still growing.'
@GAbelinc answers 'heh, I have the history of wonder woman on a bookshelf upstairs'
@CGritznakka gossips 'Good night'
@CGorsk gossips 'cya'

@GStarling answers 'wasn't it awol?  I guess that got changed'
@C(Gossip) Brillig is cruising for some extra special kinky @YChicken @Rwuvvin!
@GAbelinc answers 'it was'
@GSnooky answers 'Correct, it was awol. Napalm was aight too'
@GXaxz answers 'Woah... so now boot has DoH's clanskill'
@GAbelinc answers 'all clan's v2 clanskill are the same, you just choose the stats'
@GAnaristos answers 'also, you might consider joining a clan, read help newbieclan and help bootcamp.'
@GAnaristos answers 'sorry, mis :)'
@GStarling answers 'I thought it was cool when Crusader had 'resurrect' as a clan skill'
@GSnooky answers 'So they are not the same then Abe'
@GStarling answers 'It would resurrect a dead mob'
@GAnaristos answers 'we have Immortality, I like it :)'
@GXaxz answers 'Quick, members of boot, double weight a bunch of trash and fill up every manor porch'
@GStarling answers 'heh, at one point Lasher changed wolf's clanskill to "TakingCrap"'
@GAnaristos answers 'clan leaving is not a frequent activity.'
@GAnaristos answers 'mis again :)'
@GAnaristos answers 'we do take a lot of crap from people.'
@G(Answer) Anaristos eyes Starling suspiciously.
@GStarling answers 'Oh, give me a break.  I harp on your over-moderation of gossip and not much else :p'
@GAnaristos answers 'she would be understandable if you were a frequent curse flyer, but you are not. So your sticking your paw into something that doesn't affect you.'
@GStarling answers 'hm, mischan?'
@GAnaristos answers 'no :)'
@GSnooky answers 'And Daoine had a cool theme that will be sorely missed'
@GAnaristos answers 'bad grammar but no mischan.'
@GStarling answers 'I'm sticking my paw into something that doesn't affect me?  '
@GAnaristos answers 'yes, if you were a regular curser, I can see how you would be conserned about the moderation of curse on the channel ,but you are not.'
@GAnaristos answers 'concerned*'
@GSnooky questions 'How much has Anaristos had to drink tonight?'
@GAnaristos answers 'at any rate, I am done discussing the subject :)'
@GStarling answers 'Moderation of curse is fine, I'm more concerned about the moderation of topic, especially when the topic isn't offensive or otherwise questionable'
@GAnaristos answers 'what's offensive is as subjective as it gets, Starling. So moderation is a fuction of the moderator.'
@GStarling answers 'And I contend that the moderation has been stricter than it needs to be.'
@GAnaristos answers 'to say something shouldn't be as moderated because YOU feel it's not required is a useless position.'
@GAnaristos answers 'you are entitled to that view but it doesn't change anything.'
@GXaxz questions 'The gossip channel still exists?  Turned that cancer tunnel off years ago'
@GAnaristos answers 'when you become the moderator then I can take the same position or one similar and it won't make any difference.'
@GStarling answers 'Because I feel?  You might be surprised at the number of comments (tells) I get from people saying you're too strict.  Some of them are less politely worded but we'll go with that.'
@GStarling answers 'The only difference is I have no problem giving you that feedback, and that's really all it is'
@GAnaristos answers 'has nothing to do whether you feel, it has to do with the fact that feelings are private no matter how much you want to share them and you cannot say to someone 'I feel this or that' and expect it to be applicable.'
@GAnaristos answers 'it melted all the bad meat :)'
@GAnaristos answers 'mis!'

@GTrachx answers 'ppal knight levels really fast in low level range'
@GTrachx answers 'blacksmith is probably also as fast'
@GRugal answers 'blacksmith needs aura of sanc and bp'
@GTrachx answers 'assassin will need pretty fast in higher level range, at least I hope so :P'
@GLeprosinho questions 'I want to try a different class at T7 and I need to decide between paladin, mage and thief ...'
@GTrachx answers 'if you are able to target individual mobs you can consider thief - but that class is weak, you kill fast but for less exp'
@GCelebrity answers 'from t7, assassin rocks. 1-80 level instakills'
@GTrachx answers 'charge is level 73 - but that will require a lot of quaffing refresh at lower levels and a lot of quaffing heal (like every round) at 150+'
@GCelebrity answers 'insta- literal insta. no lags'
@GRugal answers 'mage has high damage,thief has quick execution when its 1vs1,paladin got charge..'
@GTrachx answers 'well, if you have quickstab on, which requires a lot of dex/luck , also str for high damage backstab'
@GTrachx answers 'and using backstab before 30-40 is slower thatn jus kill'
@GTrachx answers 'however good thing about thi is you do not need other stats: for example now I have 24 int (117 with eq and spells) and 20 (108 with eq and spells) con trained, and 74 wis (so I was able to get total 100 wis relatively early)'
@GCelebrity answers 'well. i often cleared the whole nulan area before repops with assassin. dunno if other classes could do that'
@GTrachx answers 'and 201 str/dex and 171 luck'
@GTrachx answers 'also for example as other classes I am able to kill athletes in SOH at 155, but with assassin it is more like 160-165'
@GLeprosinho questions 'So should I choose Assassin subclass if I go thief?'
@GTrachx answers 'if you have enough stats, if you kill slow (more than 1 round fights) then venomist is better choice'
@GLeprosinho questions 'Another question ... when I got some aoe attacks after remort should I use them?'
@GTrachx answers 'no'
@GTrachx answers 'unless low level when mobs just die because of your rough power'
@GTrachx answers 'but at higher levels typical assassin fights look like: strangle, backstab, spiral'
@GTrachx answers 'you strangle mob to increase backstab damage (strangle for assassin is no-lag skill, just recovery)'
@GTrachx answers 'also being neutral helps'

@GKallaz answers 'I ate 7 volleys in a row without being able to move'

@G(Answer) Beastboy snickers with Kallaz about their shared secret.
@GMyth questions 'besides the only thing volley does is it removes recovery lag from archery skill'
@GBeastboy answers 'enjoyed my volley :p? relax i am not gonna attack you no more, not this mort'
@GKallaz answers 'oh I don't mind, but I see this every time now'
@GRugal answers 'ahhh,interesting'
@G(Answer) Rugal beams a smile at Beastboy.
@GKallaz answers 'I am just wondering because the mud always eats every command I throw during the arrows'
@GKallaz answers 'so I am confused if there actually is a way to do anything'
@GTrachx answers 'with volley hunter gets 5-6 no-lag shots, just like they were single command'
@GKallaz answers 'I got 2 different rounds in the mob fight I was in though'
@GKallaz answers 'so I would think that I should be able to cast/heal '
@GKallaz answers 'I dont mind dying to it, just curious if there is literally any defense, or if u just have to sit there and eat them all'

@GRebornatus questions 'I'm curious to understand how hitrolla nd damroll work. Help doesn't provide much... help'
@GRalyn answers 'hitroll affects how often you hit, damroll affects how hard you hit'
@GRebornatus questions 'for instance when you have diff weapon, how can you tell if +1 str is better than +5 DR for example'
@GByrnatha answers 'from what I understand, hitroll affects how often you hit a target. damroll affects how hard you hit.'
@GTrachx answers 'get HR to 1300 and DR to 1800 and you should be fine :P'
@GRebornatus questions 'That's the aprt that is in help...'
@GRalyn answers 'and that explains it'
@GRalyn answers 'if you're wondering if 1 str is better than 5 DR, you have to try each, and see how hard you hit.'
@GRebornatus questions 'is it beeter to have a weapon with 100 average dammage and 0 bonuses or a 90 av damange and +5HT and +5DR. How can you tell?'
@GRalyn answers 'try each, and see how hard you hit'
@GRalyn answers 'dtrack can help'
@GByrnatha answers 'so if you have low damroll but high hitroll, you may be landing a lot of blows to your enemy, but you're not going to be doing a lot of damage.'
@GRalyn answers 'help dtrack'
@GRalyn answers 'it's a damage tracker, you can equip one, reset dtrack and check stats after some fights. reset it, equip other, and check it after some fights'
@GRebornatus questions 'dtrack looks cool. I didn't know that. Thx'
@GStarling answers 'that only works in theory'
@GStarling answers 'your sample will have so much noise in it, will be hard to draw any meaningful conclusions'
@GTrachx answers 'also remember to check "dtrack hits" that helps to find out how effective are your instincts'
@GRalyn answers 'I don't think he needs to know about instincts :P'
@GKylia answers 'oooh, didn't know about dtrack hits!'
@GKallaz answers 'ooh I didnt realize it actually noted hits from instinct'
@GKallaz answers 'maybe I didnt have enough instinct to make it matter before, thats awesome'

@CReltubydoc gossips 'unfortunately for you, liber, you won't have the time to make a final speach before you parish... LIKE THE ONE YOU KILLED!'
@C(Gossip) Reltubydoc , with just one slice of his blade, decapitates liber!
@CReltubydoc gossips 'I told you, kit, that I would come back again and again anda again and... I don't want to do this again. Anyway, I'll just keep coming back! Also, you spelt gossip wrong'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'but just to show you, here's a demonstration.'
@YAlenon barters:@w Freggle Thank you very much! :)
@CReltubydoc gossips 'starling, now's the time to ban me'
@CStarling gossips 'reltubydoc is like a mexican drug runner, just can't keep him out'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'ok. I'll do it myself'
@C(Gossip) Reltubydoc breaks down in tears, crying 'Ban me now, please!'
@CZhalut gossips 'why does cody always ask for a ban?'
@CStarling gossips 'ketamine'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'I do it to show you that banning me will do nothing for you'
@CRumour gossips 'depends on who does the banning :P'
@CStarling gossips 'JUST like deporting a mexican drug runner :/'
@CMonst gossips 'I know who does the banning'
@C(Gossip) Monst suddenly shouts @W"AND HIS NAME IS JOHN CENA!"
@CReltubydoc gossips 'yes. If rumour bans me, I can't come back. However,'
@CStarling gossips 'Eh, that's not strictly true either ;)'
@C(Gossip) Rumour fluffles Reltubydoc's fur mercilessly.
@CReltubydoc gossips 'ok rumour, anaristos, mordist, koridel, all with imms can ban me if I get out of line'
@CMonst gossips 'were you ever in?'
@C(Gossip) Starling draws the line in the sane.
@CRumour gossips 'and we can also unban you :P'
@CStarling gossips 'Step over the line, please.'
@CMonst gossips 'he crossed the line of sane a long time ago...'
@CRumour gossips 'besides you have to do a LOT more than what you have been doing to get to that stage, so I have no idea why you fret so much about it'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'I'm pretty sure if I step over that line, starling will sban me but she will also sban me if I don't step over it.'
@CStarling gossips 'What did he do, exactly?  Shoot somebody's dog?'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'I fret so much about it because I really do not want to get to where I am again. It may not seem like much but it took me a while to get to this remort'
@CAnchin gossips 'starling can only ban you from their own experience, not from the mud'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'I didn't shoot any dogs. I'm not a hunter. I have however killed a few dogs in the past. One of them for a campaign'
@CMonst gossips 'One does not simply ban the Reltubydoc'
@CStarling gossips 'Which clearly I haven't, given that I haven't used ignore and nobody has done anything to me that would warrant it.'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'and btw, that was not the same campaign as the campaign with the dame I needed to tame that was slain'
@CMonst gossips 'but was there two the same?'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'if anyone remembers that joke, I'll be surprised'
@C(Gossip) Starling peers intently at Reltubydoc.
@CStarling gossips 'Build up your history to what mine is and then you can worry about your future here. :)'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'a while ago, endymion told me that taming a dame was the key to fame. So I looked for a dame to tame that hadn't been slain. Once I'd f? the dame, she was slain for a campaign. I thought this was lame and a shame so I instead took apart in a lasertag game.'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'found'
@CStarling gossips 'And then Starling thought you were lame, so she banned your sorry hind end.'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'you started banning me long before that happened'
@CStarling gossips 'I just randomly used 'sban' on you one day.  Apologies if I gave you a complex.  Really, I was just messing around.'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'I believe it was the same day where I said I would give cheese to the winner of the next war. Endymion won but he left before I could give him the cheese. It was just a chunk of rotten cheese I found in the den of thieves so he wouldn't have f? it useful in any way'
@CMonst gossips 'I don't even remember who I killed yesterday...'
@C(Gossip) Gorsk raises his hand.
@CReltubydoc gossips 'nah. You've started a long running joke, even longer than monst's riots or snooky's yumbo'
@C(Gossip) Gorsk bursts into tears.
@CMonst gossips 'How can I kill what is already dead to me, Gorsk?'
@C(Gossip) Monst burps loudly.
@C(Gossip) Gorsk chuckles at Monst's joke.
@CReltubydoc gossips 'it started long before the Aardwolf! Info! Channel and even before gritznakka made his return'
@CGorsk gossips 'cause what is dead might eat your brains :)'
@CMonst gossips 'what brains?'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'don't worry. '
@CReltubydoc gossips 'zshot zombie'
@C(Gossip) Gorsk keeps his brains in his stomach.
@C(Gossip) Reltubydoc pulls out a shotgun and blows the brains out of the zombified a zombie!
@CGuardian of the Loud'ra@C asks, @c"@CWhat is the best way to harness the power of the elements?@c"
@CReltubydoc gossips 'I'll be gone for a while '
@CMonst gossips 'miss me, will you'
@CGuardian of the Loud'ra@C says, @c"@CThank you for your help.@c"
@CStarling gossips 'Can I have your stuff before you go?'
@C(Gossip) Starling's shifty eyes dart back and forth.
@CAnaristos gossips 'did the meds delivery person fail to show up?'
@CMonst gossips 'we ate him'
@CStarling gossips 'We'll get you your antipsychotics at a later time'
@C(Gossip) Gorsk burps loudly.
@CStarling gossips 'Until then, please return to your straight jacket.'
@CMonst gossips 'you don't feed your followers, we get hungry Anaristos. What did you expect?'
@CAnaristos gossips 'buy a drink container'
@CMonst gossips 'Hey yo, do I look like Im rollin in dough?'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'monst, the great and powerful creators of the realm provide us with enough to survive so stop trying to start a "riot." If you want some water, run u3n from recall. '
@CMonst gossips 'it is not a "riot" comrade'
@C(Gossip) Monst flips a table. Mother Trucking RIOT!
@CReltubydoc gossips 'I just think the immortals don't get enough respect for what they do for us'
@C(Gossip) Monst bows before the cool version of Xeno.
@CReltubydoc gossips 'strange. Someone gave me a container full of level 200 equipment '
@CLiber gossips 'cursed? :)'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'to whoever gave me the container, thank you. '
@C(Gossip) Gorsk snickers with Liber about their shared secret.
@CReltubydoc gossips 'is it actually cursed?'
@CGorsk gossips 'unlikely'
@GKitCarson questions 'I was planning to get the scholar wish... is it worth it ?'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'because liber said it was'
@CMonst gossips 'there are two ways to find out...'
@CGorsk gossips 'id it'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'I don't think it's cursed'
@GRugal answers 'according to me...no'
@GGorsk answers 'it really shines when you have instinct'
@G(Answer) Anaristos glares at Rugal.
@GMonst answers 'so you fail recall 5 times instead of 15... '
@GRugal answers 'gonna master everything as use it,right? why sacrifice qp for impatience? i mastered spear of odin in 3 levels'
@GReltubydoc answers 'I think portal, exprit, etc are better'
@GLiber answers 'there are other skills/spells, except combat'
@GAnaristos answers 'you shouldn't fail recall at all. If you practice it to 100% it will work at just about that rate.'
@GLiber answers 'for example bypass is a little more dificult to get to 100%'
@GRugal answers 'come on,10%? really'
@GReltubydoc answers 'I mastered spear of oden in 2 levels!'
@GKarlijn answers 'I never masted spear of odin at all'
@GLiber answers 'to "master" bypass, you need something like 150 cps and hundreds of quests :)'
@GLiber answers 'so, having it at 95% might help '
@GAnaristos answers 'would it have to do with the fact you are a pwar?'
@GKarlijn answers 'yes I think so :)'
@G(Answer) Liber smirks.
@GRugal answers '8k qp for 10%? rather get exprate,spellup faster, save for stat cost or pockets'
@GReltubydoc answers 'I never failed to recall when it was only at 50%'
@GRugal answers 'and anyways,portals never fail'
@GLiber answers 'the fact that higher percentage means little for SOME spells doesn't mean it's useless for ALL spells :)'
@CGorsk gossips 'portals don't work in combat'
@GAnaristos answers 'can't use a portal during combat.'
@CGorsk gossips 'mis'
@GReltubydoc answers 'oh yeah. I forgot about the spellup wishes'
@GLiber answers 'you don't campaign much, du you? :)'
@GLiber answers 'do*'
@GRugal answers 'useless man,same with passdoor.'
@GMonst answers 'you know the best wish?'
@G(Answer) Liber laughs out loud.
@GLiber answers 'passdoor is probably one of the bestbuys :)'
@GGorsk answers 'i love my passdoor wish'
@GRugal answers 'most of the time you above 50,if you have thief/psi you will have pass door most of the time'
@GLiber answers 'Monst: yes. World peace.'
@GMonst answers 'something like that'
@GReltubydoc answers 'I might get passdoor once I tier and become another race. The ability to pass all non-warded doors is too good to pass up'
@GKitCarson answers 'thank you all :)'
@GRugal answers 'i won't Even buy a bp at level 1'
@GReltubydoc answers 'who needs resistance to magic when you can pass doors? xd'
@GKitCarson answers 'for now I only whished pockets, to have space for some half sets after remort'
@GMonst answers 'Santa'
@GRugal answers 'it's not like sophia the caretaker can kill ya'
@GReltubydoc answers 'yeah but I'm too lazy to get keys'
@GReltubydoc answers 'monst, did you say santa's here?'
@GRugal answers 'drop the keys in front of the door?'
@GLiber answers 'immunities are nice, weaponmaster is the closest it comes to "must have" (at least for non-warriors), exprate is a "must-have" for anyone who wants to pup, fasthunt is useful for campaigners'
@GLiber answers 'and passdoor is passdoor :) priceless, unless you are psi or cleric AND use shadow'
@GRugal answers 'changing all my weaps to daggers was cheaper than weaponmaster'
@GLiber answers 'until you go pcleric. then all your daggers would be useless :)'
@GReltubydoc answers 'practicing weapon types doesn't take that long'
@GMonst answers 'chop 9/10 of the sword off, shave the handle down a bit and boom! dagger'
@GRugal answers 'why would i not be sure of wich class i like?'
@GLiber answers 'Reltubydoc: it's not about 100%, it's about having them all regardless of pclass :)'
@GReltubydoc answers 'yeah but you still don't get hammer'
@GLiber answers 'and you'd need hammer because...? :)'
@GValour questions 'Does someone know where is the key for trophy room in aardington? I can't find it'
@G(Answer) Rugal peers intently at Valour.
@GLiber answers 'there no Aard hammer from questor. and what you made into hammer yourself, you can turn back :)'
@GRugal answers 'look up a map,someone hit him with a website'
@G(Answer) Reltubydoc wields an aylorian hammer. Reltubydoc drops the hammer on his fingers! Reltubydoc's smash wounds him (18)!
@GLiber answers 'I doubt you got that from questor :)'
@GValour answers 'I already looked to maps Rugal.'
@GRugal answers 'hint:its in a desk'
@GReltubydoc answers 'there is no aard hammer. And even if there was, why would I waste 1000 qp on a weapon I can't use?'
@G(Answer) Valour thanks Rugal heartily.
@GLiber answers 'http://aardseekermaps.mygamesonline.org/aardington.php'
@GMonst answers 'we know the answer Rel...'
@GKippe answers 'Valour the key lopcation is on one of the online maps'
@GLiber answers 'Reltubydoc: that's why it doesn't matter that weaponsmaster doesn't include hammer'
@GValour answers 'yea yea I got it thanks to Rugal's little hint :D'
@GReltubydoc answers 'yes. The hammer I baught off auction was a mistake.'
@GReltubydoc answers 'ok thanks'
@GRugal answers 'don't go telling people i help people'
@GLiber answers 'if you mean the aylorian hammer, it doesn't really matter. if you bought a quest weapon turned to hammer, you can have it turned back by a blacksmith'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'hey everyone! Rugal helps people!'
@GAnaristos answers 'your secret is safe with us, Rugal.'
@GReltubydoc answers 'yeah it's really safe. '
@CValour gossips 'Yes! I could not find the key without his help!'
@G(Answer) Reltubydoc . o O ( please ignore what I said on gossip. )
@GAnaristos answers 'you can't back up the water that has gone under the bridge :)'
@CSnooky gossips 'Tugal helps people'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'I already said that'
@GRugal answers 'c petrify water'
@GRugal answers 'done'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'but there is someone who helps people even more...'
@CValour gossips 'but you said ignore what I said. So hi did'
@C(Gossip) Reltubydoc suddenly shouts @W"AND HIS NAME IS JOHN CENA!"
@CSnooky gossips 'I see someone else'
@CSnooky gossips 'I uh need to ugh'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'a new player will log on soon...'
@C(Gossip) Reltubydoc suddenly shouts @W"AND HIS NAME IS JOHN CENA!"
@C(Gossip) Monst grabs Reltubydoc and drops him with an @YR@GK@RO@w!
@C(Gossip) After Reltubydoc's stupid remark, Starling baps him upside the head; he DID deserve it.
@C(Gossip) Reltubydoc grabs Monst and drops him with an @YR@GK@RO@w!
@C(Gossip) Monst turns the tables with a devastating RIOT!
@C(Gossip) @R[1] Reltubydoc's toxic cloud does UNSPEAKABLE things to you! [OMG]
@C(Gossip) Reltubydoc attaches a pump to Monst and inflates him until he explodes.
@CReltubydoc gossips 'clan name: the followers of the riot. Leaders: monst. Clanskill: riot, tablefrip.'
@CStarling gossips 'Uh, no, only I lead the RIOT'
@CStarling gossips 'RIOT'
@CStarling gossips 'RIOT'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'epic riot battles of history! Monst! Vs! Starling! Begin'
@CLiber gossips 'My bets are on Anaristos.'
@C(Gossip) Liber blinks innocently.
@CReltubydoc gossips 'same'
@C(Gossip) Monst reins his horse next to Starling and salutes her with his lance.
@CMonst gossips 'I will not cross swords with a member of the RIOT movement'
@CMonst gossips 'united we stand, divided we fall blah blah'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'the man with the snail with never fail. While the two are rioting, anaristos starts on their trail. '
@CReltubydoc gossips 'levels for riot (sn: monst) nofail skill. Mage level: n/a, cleric level: n/a, monst level: 1, starling level: 1.'
@CMonst gossips 'chance of success? minimal'
@CVherin gossips 'Has the Realm of the Zodiac been updated recently? The maps on the net don't match.'
@CMonst gossips 'effort input? max'
@CStarling gossips 'It has indeed been updated recently.'
@CLiber gossips 'board announce, note read 1286'
@CStarling gossips 'I want to form an Aardwolf political party'
@CStarling gossips 'I will call it LOOTNEXT'
@C(Gossip) Starling's shifty eyes dart back and forth.
@CVherin gossips 'Thank you.'
@C(Gossip) Monst glares at Starling.
@CMonst gossips 'Don't try it! I have the high ground!'
@CLiber gossips 'we do have a Pirate Party'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'and anyone who joins those pirates will get HOOKED on the idea'
@C(Gossip) Monst enthusiastically high-fives Reltubydoc!
@CStarling gossips 'Just like your mom got hooked on crack'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'because hook clan? hooked? '
@C(Gossip) Starling fluffles Reltubydoc's fur mercilessly.
@CMonst gossips 'as in... canal?'
@CMonst gossips 'without the c?'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'pirates? Hook clan? '
@CReltubydoc gossips 'I guess someone will have to cast "remove curse" on this channel.'
@CStarling gossips 'There's no cursing happening.  Don't go playing into Unfun Uptightonia's hands.'
@C(Gossip) Monst is looking for trouble.
@CReltubydoc gossips 'if the riot clan didexist, there would be a polacy on calling mobs MONSTers.'
@CMonst gossips 'yeah, just to piss off the original and ONLY one...'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'lasher tells the. wolf administration, "There is an urgent situation that needs attention IMMediately!"'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'immediate-ediately?'
@CMonst gossips 'its Immportant?'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'no "IMM-ediately," because the wolf administration is made up of the imms?'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'oh... good one.'
@CMonst gossips 'its an Immergency'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'it will have an immpact on the mud'
@CMonst gossips 'thats immpressive'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'after remorting 7 times, a player bursts into tiers'
@C(Gossip) Liber falls down laughing.
@CMonst gossips 'like a cocoon from a butterfly...'
@CAnaristos gossips 'after remorting 6 times.'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'sorry. That was just a typo'
@C(Gossip) Liber scuttles.
@CReltubydoc gossips 'what would the wolfadministrations favourite non-playable race be?'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'immp '

@YAkira barters:@w and here i was selling them for 1tp...
@GGrimvald answers 'I don't think so, unless it's a mob prog as part of a goal'
@YKash barters:@w same :p
@YAkira barters:@w beter make em max DR and 5 stat res/8 stat illum for those prices toneloc :P
@YBauer barters:@w bid 571, going cheap compared to 570!
@GTrachx answers 'read contents followers'
@YMael barters:@w doesn't even have max stats
@YKash barters:@w lol bauer
@YToneloc barters:@w unlike them ill make sure they have 7+ stats +6 DR, can get costly
@GZengo answers 'you may want to check out contents followers'
@YToneloc barters:@w mael you noob max stats dont matter
@YToneloc barters:@w just makes my job harder, but i have maxed stats that i need
@YMorn barters:@w selling 3 incomps for 1m each
@YMael barters:@w yeah, what do i know...i've only enchanted thousands of items
@YPwar barters:@w I bought a set of gear from Mael and I was using it and all of a sudden it just burst into flames, I was very upset
@YAkira barters:@w i'm curious about this +7 stats +6dr
@YEndymion barters:@w i will pay 2TP per item for any +7 resonates
@YToneloc barters:@w well let me teach you something, the higher the stat the better of a chance to get the better stats and the less garbage pieces, ill just have more garbage pieces than you
@YMael barters:@w is that why you're charging twice as much, because it costs you twice as much?
@YKash barters:@w hehe endy
@YToneloc barters:@w my sets will have a +4 Illuminate and +3 reasonate minimum with a +6 DR on every item
@YZengo barters:@w lol, yeah considering that most open clan item have either res OR illum
@YAkira barters:@w your.... open sets?
@YAkira barters:@w with 2 enchantable slots?
@YMael barters:@w maybe he's spending tp to toggle
@YToneloc barters:@w ok so itll have reasonate and a solidify or a illuminate and solidify
@Y(@WGroup@Y) @YOmerye: 'Next Union in 28 ticks (14m) for 2 ticks (1m).'
@YAkira barters:@w i'll buy a few sets then
@YToneloc barters:@w notice how the enchanters are all hating on me, stfu
@YPwar barters:@w I think they were hating on your price scheme mainly
@YAkira barters:@w well i'm down with your prices if the rest are
@YToneloc barters:@w well they dont have to buy them
@YEndymion barters:@w its probably more profitable to sell incomplete pots to icecool and the gang, timewise anyway
@YMael barters:@w pardon me for not liking it when someone takes advantage of newbs
@YIcecool barters:@w I'm always looking for someone to bot..erm brew... 400+ dbl incs for 50k/pot
@YKash barters:@w oh ill start doing that then ice
@YMuzmuz barters:@w i pay only 80k per dbl inco pot.....
@YRobbo barters:@w Godot's not around to help with that anymore.
@YToneloc barters:@w no one has to buy them, thats my prices dont like it type ignore toneloc
@YKash barters:@w just never thought itd be profitable to do it
@YToneloc barters:@w besides if your a noob and buying quality enchanted items then youre gonna pay top prices
@YToneloc barters:@w i just asked a t0 how much gold and tps they have, the response i got was 75M gold and 24Tps shit they got more gold and tps then me
@YBamboo barters:@w Did you ask a sn00b?
@YMaruxus barters:@w t0, i've got 5.5mil and 14tp
@YLiber barters:@w Ask Hrutwang! Ask Hrutwang!
@YMaruxus barters:@w course i keep all my gold tied up in portal bids
@YCytan barters:@w Luxury life is expensive.  Think that guy who has a really nice manor is rich?  He's poor because of that manor!
@YCytan barters:@w If you're not poor, you're not doing it right.
@CSteve Garland@C says '@CGreat night for a stroll, huh?@w'
@YToneloc barters:@w you have enough tps to buy a lvl 1 set lvl 91 set and level 171 set and thats all you need to level for now
@YCytan barters:@w I have enough TP to buy a Christmas tree :)
@YUllin barters:@w the reality is, with disenchant, enchanted sets should cost less, but yet TPs are not divisible, so ... either double or triple TPs overnight in players inventories...or introduce TP fractions
@YMaruxus barters:@w i've got to get pockets first, but i might hit you up toneloc
@YSnooky barters:@w we broke out here
@CSteve Garland@C says '@CThese guys have no sense of humor.@w'
@YBamboo barters:@w Heh, enchanted sets should cost less?
@YPwar barters:@w isn't a tp divisible by using gold..?
@YLiber barters:@w hey, I'm not broke! I live a fruga virtual life...
@YToneloc barters:@w with me you wont get 5DR or +4Wis or +2 resonates, youre getting +3 or better resonates +4 illuminates and alwasy +6DR
@YUllin barters:@w didn't know you can break a TP with gold... :)
@YLiber barters:@w frugal(
@CSteve Garland@C says '@CThese guys have no sense of humor.@w'
@YUllin barters:@w yes sets should cost less, takes less time to do after disenchant, and yet still 1TP because you can't break TPs!!
@CYou gossip 'cp target: a cook (The Kitchen)'
@YToneloc barters:@w the thing is i had people make me sets in 30 minutes, and had crappy pieces and still paid tps, my sets take a few hours minimum to make
@CYou gossip 'That narrows things down.'
@YMorn barters:@w 1tp is fair for a level 1 set
@YBamboo barters:@w Have you ever tried making sets?
@YToneloc barters:@w you think making sets is easy?
@YLiber barters:@w classchange is free too. so go enchanter, do your sets, if you think it's cheaper
@YToneloc barters:@w might fail 20 pieces before i get a good one maybe even more
@YAsuras barters:@w you do not really need a set, you just buy aardquest item set! :p
@YUllin barters:@w So are you guys saying disenchant doesn't make it easier?
@YSnooky barters:@w Toneloc put together an awesome lv1 set for me.
@YUllin barters:@w was 1TP before disenchant ... 1TP later ... I am blaming the immutable TP
@YToneloc barters:@w sure might make it cheaper but it only works on maybe 1 out of 10 pieces
@YLiber barters:@w it makes it faster. it makes it cheaper, considering the production prices
@YBauer barters:@w and you sell the rest abck to shop keeper fro money back too
@YLiber barters:@w but that is NOT the only cost :)
@YBauer barters:@w i made a 131 set for 1.5million gold the other day with 4+ stats and 6dr
@YBamboo barters:@w You do realize that enchanters are selling sets a whole lot cheaper than the value for the time it takes to make them, right?
@YToneloc barters:@w how long did it take?
@YToneloc barters:@w to make a GOOD set takes hours
@GZcrim questions 'You receive (halved) 79+8 experience points.???'
@GBamboo answers 'help grace'
@YUllin barters:@w I am just saying, difficulty/time required went lower, and price didn't. So it's either because of oligopolistic behavior OR due to the market structure (indivisible TPs)
@CTaeryn gossips 'Did you check over there?'
@GZcrim answers 'thanks!'
@YPwar barters:@w you keep saying indivisible tps but what prevents people from using 3mil gold as .5 tp I don't understand
@YBamboo barters:@w It's because we're already selling dirt-cheap sets in the first place. We can't go any lower, otherwise it's not worth doing
@YPwar barters:@w if people sell tps for 5mil then .5 tp is worth 2.5-3mil..
@YUllin barters:@w enchanters COLLUDE and FIX TARIFFs ... get out AArdAantitrust authority
@Y(@WGroup@Y) @YOmerye: 'Next Union in 234 ticks (1h:57m) for 3 ticks (1m:30s).'
@YUllin barters:@w OR break the TPs! (add a command at Ravi BreakTP # where # is number of pieces, or MendTP)
@YLiber barters:@w when buying from an enchanter, you don't pay the enchanter's costs to build the sets, you pay for your convenience of being able to pup/level with your favorite pclass/subclass that is NOT mage/enchanter
@YMorn barters:@w that would assume only mage/enchanter can enchant which very not true
@YTrachx barters:@w you're also paying for enchanter's time as it takes 30-40 minutes to create a set
@YTrachx barters:@w in that time you can earn 5 mil gold and 80 pups

@CZaippot@C asks, @c"@CWhere could my date be?@c"
@CAn upset diner@C exclaims, @c"@CFinally! Someone has put me out of my misery!@c"
@YTrachx barters:@w for low level set (for 1-2 tps) cost of elements is low, but then 1TP for a set - it just barely covers time required to create a set
@CA star to wish upon@C asks, @c"@CWell, if you really want, though I don't see the attraction in the ocean, myself. Big, salty pond filled with filthy seaweed and slimy creatures.  Let's face it, who really wants to play with a jellyfish?@c"
@YUllin barters:@w I am just pointing out disenchant made it quicker, yet since TPs can't be divided, a set still costs the same
@YBamboo barters:@w Exactly. Why would I waste my time to make a "good" set for 1 lousy tp? Well to be honest, I do sets as a form of charity for newer players
@YLiber barters:@w it's not only the time to do sets. that would be true if an enchanter would have orders to do sets all the time
@YLiber barters:@w the enchanter has combat penalties all the time
@YBamboo barters:@w Disenchant did not really make much difference. It helps, but not as much as you perceive it
@YLiber barters:@w this is why it doesn't really matter if you can do the set in 30 minutes or in 10 minutes
@YBamboo barters:@w You can't infinitely disenchant an enchantment
@YLiber barters:@w my guess is the price will remain largly the same even if the enchants would be almost failproof
@YMael barters:@w i disagree, i think it made a huge difference, having done many enchants before and after the change
@YTrachx barters:@w enchanters may profit only from sets that cost more than 2 tps - so like 131/171/201 - but then cost of elements is approx 1TP per set (that includes selling back items)
@CYou gossip 'so each tier i can use a free reroll right? try another main class?'
@YMael barters:@w i have reset a flag as many as 10x in a row before, how much time/cost did that save
@CTrachx gossips 'yes'
@YAkira barters:@w disenchant does not make enchanting quicker, it makes it cheaper
@YTrachx barters:@w I think with disenchants it is 50% of what it was before
@YMael barters:@w it's both
@YLiber barters:@w it makes the quicker. you have to chances to land the "right" resonate on a perfect solidify, not only one
@YLiber barters:@w that's quicker :)
@CTrachx gossips 'you can also try new main class every 50 days for free (using classchange)'
@YLiber barters:@w two chances, not to
@YMael barters:@w you land 12 stats but only 1hr, how much more time until you land 12 stats again
@YAkira barters:@w it can be
@YTrachx barters:@w it takes quite a lot casts to get +6dr solid, +4/+4 illuminate, and +3/+2 specific stat (like str/dex) for resonate
@YMael barters:@w the main benefit from disenchant is time spent imo
@YAkira barters:@w i am mistaken, you are right it does save time
@YMael barters:@w and the time spent taking your stats to 395 saves you hours in the long run if you're talking long-term enchanting activity
@YMael barters:@w especially since you only have to do it once now
@YLiber barters:@w a similar situation: the cost for maxstats tempers. if a temper costs 500k, with the buyer's ore, then hell, 4-5 tps for a lvl. 200 set is dirt cheap
@YTrachx barters:@w besides with DB TP cps it is much easier now to earn tps, I think you get 12-15 per remort or so
@YUllin barters:@w excuses excuses ... DB was introduced before enchant
@YEndymion barters:@w in my experience its more like 8-10 TP/remort
@YEndymion barters:@w maybe if you CP every level 12-15
@YLiber barters:@w in mine it's around 30. but I'm leveling slowly :)
@YTrachx barters:@w you should cp req campaign every level (but you can cp quit if there is no tp reward)
@YByrnatha barters:@w Thanksgiving turkey, bid 580

@GEndymion answers 'i guess i just didnt understand why it lists instances can be added, if its just a new object.  i guess if cost is the same it would just be easier than creating from scratch to say, 'hey use this but make it 4x lvl 120''
@YGrayghost barters:@w no
@GTrachx answers 'no, that is another object so you pay 100%'

@GTrachx answers 'but then you will have just 1 potion (the new one) in your manor'

@GTrachx answers 'no'
@GTrachx answers 'I mean you do not pay less because they just copied that object'
@GEndymion answers 'right, i assume price would be full'
@GTrachx answers 'you pay less only if you are modifying base object'
@GEndymion answers 'i guess i was having a hard time understanding what 'instances' are in this case, since it wouldnt be an object upgrade'
@GEndymion answers 'if its just adding a new item from scratch then what does that have to do with it and why would 4 be max if you can technically have up to 8 objects'
@GEndymion answers 'when you did yours are they identical except for level? did you just request the 4 diff ones with same descriptions etc?'
@GTrachx answers 'no, they are different , just all 3 are 4 * black lotus of different level'
@GEndymion answers 'ah ok maybe im over thinking it.  maybe theres up to 4 of each type of potion for example?'
@GEndymion answers 'so not instance of my creation, instance of mana pots in general'

@GEndymion answers 'i think thats what it means'
@CA troll guard@C exclaims, @c"@CFriend of the elves, begone!@c"

@CSivak gossips 'that arist guy?'
@C(Gossip) Reltubydoc grabs Monst and drops him with an @YR@GK@RO@w!
@CReltubydoc gossips 'he wasn't on the wizlist'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'and... unfortunately, even though he calls himself, "The hardest. working Aard Immortal," Dexx isn't on the list either. I guess dexx is kind of an imm but not really because he is only level 201... I'm going too deep. Let's just call him the greatest human enchanter aardwolf has ever seen'
@CAnaristos gossips 'you got it wrong, he is not referring to himself when he says that.'
@CFenix gossips 'yea, if he was an imm we would never get spells :P'
@CMickey gossips 'think he says "in honor of," not calling himself that'

@CAnaristos gossips 'we can't fight entropy'
@CMonst gossips 'of course we can'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'no offence to any of the immortals, but your whois info is kind of weird. You all... well the ones I checked had more qp than they had earned and they had only killed a small number of mobs. '
@C(Gossip) Monst launches a Mother Trucking RIOT! Eat that... Entropy!
@CReltubydoc gossips 'the great one is right, monst. You cannot fight it.'
@CMonst gossips 'sounds like a challenge'
@CAnaristos gossips 'hey, I've killed 46 mobs, and I have no qps at all, earned or otherwise.'
@CRoqueWarrior gossips 'my bot kills all my mobs for me'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'sorry sir. '
@CAnaristos gossips 'we know, RoqueWarrior :>'
@CRumour gossips 'he lies!
@C(Gossip) Reltubydoc giggles as a well groomed pet rockbot tried to reach the 35.princess in his huge bot trap!
@C(Gossip) Rumour smiles and gives RoqueWarrior a chaste peck on the cheek.
@C(Gossip) RoqueWarrior whispers softly to Rumour.
@C(Gossip) Anaristos goes, "Hmmmm."

@C(Gossip) Anaristos peers intently at Monst.
@CAnaristos gossips 'I note a disturbance in the farce.'
@CRumour gossips 'there was a mighty disturbance in the force this night'
@C(Gossip) Monst suddenly shouts @W"AND HIS NAME IS JOHN CENA!"
@CAnaristos gossips 'oh yeah?'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'ever since Anaristos cast change sex, a spell that I thought could only found in potions, I have gained an all new respect for the immortals of the realm'
@CRumour gossips 'respect or fear?'
@CKazmer@C says, @c"@CHehe, you're too brave for me to scare now.@c"

@C(Gossip) Anaristos looks around and whistles innocently.
@CReltubydoc gossips 'I know these people are capeable of more impressive feats than simply changing someone's gender'
@CMonst gossips 'talk about a party trick'
@CAnaristos gossips 'yeah, levitation is boring.'
@CMonst gossips 'spiders can do the same... for... some people'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'they host trivia, ride attop legendary warsnails and have the potential to freaze me in seconds. You have to respect them'
@CMonst gossips 'Can they pull off a sick RIOT?'
@CRumour gossips 'Imms don't riot'
@CMonst gossips 'meh'
@CMonst gossips 'now that would be impressive'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'if they wanted to, monst, they probably would be able to.'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'but they don't so they won't'
@CRumour gossips 'that would be disrespectful'
@CMonst gossips 'would it though?'
@CVost gossips 'can an Imm push an immovable object?'
@CRedryn gossips 'they probably can eat it'
@CRedryn gossips 'and poop it out elsewhere'
@CMonst gossips 'Find out here, tonight! on Aardwold! Info! Channel!'
@CVost gossips 'ew!'
@CRedryn gossips '(i have seen imms do that...)'
@CRedryn gossips 'i'm pretty sure my tier pin was pooped out by one, but i wear it with pride'
@CVost gossips 'you have seen Imms pooping?'
@CRedryn gossips 'yeah'
@CStarling gossips 'so that's what that smell is'
@CVost gossips 'kinky'
@CStarling gossips 'I knew it couldn't be good'
@CRedryn gossips 'iirc it's something like <imm> squats and strains and a <item> appears!'
@C(Gossip) Redryn blinks innocently.
@CMonst gossips 'Impressive'
@CStarling gossips 'sounds like they have digestive problems from all the random items that they eat'
@CRedryn gossips 'i think it's like a magic trick'
@CRedryn gossips 'you know, the type who swallow an item, then can regurgitate it at will'
@CRedryn gossips 'except they do it one step further at the other end'
@CRumour gossips 'actually, that is the testport message the accidently was copied over here for a short time'
@CRedryn gossips 'short? :p'
@CStarling gossips 'no wonder they have to strain, it sounds uncomfortable'
@CRedryn gossips 'i saw it multiple times :p'
@CStarling gossips 'now I understand what Anaristos' problem is though, he's eating too much of the wrong things!'
@C(Gossip) Rumour says, in a bored tone 'whatever', and moves on to something more interesting.
@CMonst gossips 'Anaristos has a problem?'
@CRedryn gossips 'i think that social has a missing comma'
@CRedryn gossips 'please fix'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'the great creators of the realm would have better things to do'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'the great one Rumour would like to change the subject so I would suggest you do so'
@C(Gossip) Reltubydoc is still too lazy to use commas
@CRedryn gossips 'and periods'
@CRumour gossips ''full stops.''
@CRedryn gossips 'a missing period can be quite frightening you know'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'a missing full stop isn't that frightening.'
@CMonst gossips 'only for females...'
@CStarling gossips 'thank god for sterilization!'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'not appropriate for gossip'
@CMonst gossips 'more like hospitals Starling :p'
@CRedryn gossips 'i thought god is against sterilization'
@C(Gossip) Reltubydoc grabs Monst and drops him with an @YR@GK@RO@w!
@CRumour gossips 'and sterlisation is a term used for males...'
@C(Gossip) Reltubydoc is agreeing with that Rumour person again...
@CMonst gossips 'it is?'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'yes. It is'
@CRedryn gossips 'i thought sterilization is the genocide of pathogens'
@CAnaristos gossips 'leave the tamales alone!'
@CMonst gossips 'I thought it was for cleaning surgical supplies lmao'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'it is what it is so DEAL WITH IT. '
@CMonst gossips 'nah. I fold'

Something bad should happen to them, if you know what I mean.@c"
@GAbelinc answers 'I find that the best way to work on MOBs is by using "active listening skills", parroting back much of what was said...i.e. if a MOB says "Will you help me kill my brother", instead of answering "yes" or trying to guess keywords, respond more like "yes I will help you kill your brother"'

@YSnooky barters:@w sick and disgusting
@CRomantic gossips 'do they open areas that you can't get to otherwise?'
@CAbelinc gossips 'the first few morts of a tier make more power difference than tiering does'
@CAbelinc gossips 'there are some goals which cannot be done without certain classes, and a few minor rooms...but in general they don't open more areas except for the fact that you might not be strong enough as a lowmort'
@CMauler gossips 'what he said :P{'
@CRomantic gossips 'Are there synergies between skill from different classes? Are some worth  knowing before making remort choices?'
@GYou answer 'Just take your time. Use the explored command and a gaardian or seeker map online to help you out.'
@CKitCarson gossips 'what he said ??? :)'
@GYou answer 'and don't be afraid to run into walls. Sometimes they're not as solid as they look.'
@CMauler gossips 'abelinc that is'
@CAbelinc gossips 'not synergies, but you want to complement what you already have...which means going "more different" than yourself'
@GDerpindaisy questions 'thanks everyone'
@CAbelinc gossips 'in the end it doesn't matter, but having a spellcaster, a healer, and a fighter mort is stronger than having three fighter morts, for example'
@CKitCarson gossips 'sorry Mauler...I was trying to be fun.... little results yet :)'
@CAbelinc gossips 'so pwar going thief next wouldn't be as strong as the pwar going mage, psi or cleric next'
@CRomantic gossips 'I hear warrior is a good first remort for mage.  What are other good options I should consider?'
@CSirCanada gossips 'psi/cleric is good also'
@CSnooky gossips 'what about Centuars?'
@CAbelinc gossips 'I wouldn't recommend psi as second class for pmage'
@CKitCarson gossips 'total noob here... pwarrior... I LOVE my Psi remort... I go throu areas I found HARD first life like they arent even there'
@CAbelinc gossips 'they're "too alike", there's more overlap'
@CYou gossip 'I went psi/warrior for my first remort, I would recomend it. Clerics are nice, but pots are better. Give you mage some enhanced damage, fourth attacks, and dual wield :)'
@CShindo gossips 'but no hunt..'
@CSnooky gossips 'what about cleric ranger?'
@CKitCarson gossips 'or choose a wolfen race ? natural hunt'
@CTalimas gossips 'I like mage/thief for low tiers, but once u get some wishes mage/war is nice'
@CYou gossip 'No hunt for who?'
@CAbelinc gossips 'omerye: you don't take cleric/healer to use the heal spells, as pots are certainly better, but you take it for the spellups, curative and utility spells'
@CTrachx gossips 'if you consider war, thi, and ran melee - then usually you want to get war as 2nd class and thi/ran 6/7'
@CYou gossip 'I know! I was just trying ot take a cheap shot at clerics'
@C(Gossip) You wink suggestively at Abelinc.
@CTrachx gossips 'unless for some reason you need ranger or thief skills'
@CRaticus gossips 'Man, I went War/Psi/Thief. I might need to do some thinkin :P'
@CRomantic gossips 'so pmage -> war, cleric, not psi, thief (low tier) and ranger'
@CTalimas gossips 'pmage/war (cleric or psi can either be next). Buffs vs shields really'
@CYou gossip 'I jumped into thief as my 2nd or 3rd remot, and I honestnly didn't even notice.'
@CTalimas gossips 'yeah it really is war or thief the next one you take is really a moot point'
@CYou gossip 'Enhanced damage and extra attacks go soo well with mage firepower'
@CYou gossip 'So whoever can give you that. I'd recomend.'
@CTrachx gossips 'thief adds some utility skills and 42 level hunt'
@CYou gossip 'Yeha, warrior gotta wait till 70 or so'
@CTalimas gossips 'thief gives passdoor haggle and pick lock that if u are CPing a lot helps'
@CTrachx gossips 'war adds more kill power'
@CTalimas gossips 'war makes leveling WAY easier'
@CTrachx gossips 'if cping then you picks shadow navigator - fly, pass door, bypass and homecoming really help with cps'
@CAbelinc gossips 'there is a fair bit of personal preference, and dependence on your goals...thief has lots of utilities, but not as much firepower...so if you're going for convenience vs levelspeed'
@CTalimas gossips 'once u have mapper filled out pick lock is meh, and warrior is way better'
@CYou gossip 'Yes! That's what i stumpled upon. It is amazing.'
@CYou gossip 'stumbled*'
@CRomantic gossips 'What did you stumble on Omerye?'
@CZinji gossips 'so if my primary class is war ,  would be good to remort as mage ?'
@CYou gossip 'shadow navigator for 850 levels'
@CXaeris gossips 'I'd recommend psi'
@CXaeris gossips 'It has solid buff spells, great utility spells.'
@CTrachx gossips 'no, psi or cle are better than mage for secondary class'
@CRomantic gossips 'Abelinc, should I understand that thief has less firepower than war for a pmage?'
@CRaticus gossips 'Psi was pretty good as a 2nd for War.'
@CYou gossip 'Last night I took the free primary class change. Was a little bored.'
@CZinji gossips 'ok tx'
@CGartas@C exclaims, @c"@CI don't know you, and to me you look like trouble!@c"

@CTalimas gossips 'its nice there really are a lot of ways to play, and each pclass is a bit different'

@CTrEz gossips '3'
@CB'Enrai@C says, @c"@CCome here.  Yes, I mean you.@c"
@CAbelinc gossips 'war and thief both give third attack dual...but thief stops at third attack primary'

@C(Gossip) Abelinc nods at Trachx.
@CYou gossip 'agree'
@CTalimas gossips 'at low tier yea'
@CTrachx gossips 'right, if you go redo - picking pthi assassin is nice choice, but you need a lot stats for that'

@GTrachx answers 'that gives you total 600 per stat'
@GZhalut answers 'makes sense for sh. sub-sh is constantly changes. I was hoping it would be somewhere like "stats"'
@GTrachx answers 'sub-sh training stats above 201 is too expensive, so just get them to 201 and max spellup/eq (which is equal to player's level)'
@GStarling answers 'hell, going to 201 is too far in most cases'
@GStarling answers 'I like to stop at 171 and boost up things like con and wisdom'

@G(Answer) Starling seems to think you have the right idea.
@cYou tell Starling 'I'm not exactly 100% sure what you are trying to solve, but I've been pouring over the mapper and some of the other broadcast scripts to add to my own.'

@GZarra questions 'im at the murals in scarred and typed 100 or so command combos related to the quest here...nothing....what am i missing'
@CZarra gossips 'eat it'
@cStarling tells you 'now that I'm 'getting' SQL a bit more, I can only keep getting better at it, which means I should be able to make the mapper do some pretty crazy things'
@CReltubydoc gossips 'I can't. It's an animated mob'
@CZarra gossips 'ok you catch it...I'll cook it'
@cYou tell Starling 'Yes exactly! I've created a number of scripts that focused around the mapper. I've never mudded like this before.'
@cYou tell Starling 'Extreamly powerful'
@cYou tell Starling 'I haven't come across a time where you would need a wait timer in between moves, but I'm still pretty new to this mud'
@cStarling tells you 'Cexits need to wait sometimes.  Annwn, for example, you can cexit the whole rigmarole with the innkeeper and wearing the mask, but you need to make it wait @-8 seconds for the innkeeper to give you the mask, and then wait on the harbormaster @-6 seconds for him to trans you.  Once you set it up, the cexit does all the work and takes you straight to the portals.'

@cYou tell Starling 'Right now I'm attempting to bypass the need for the muds rt command all together, to better take advantage of mapper portal aliases'
@cStarling tells you 'I'm going to try to change the way it handles maze-flagged rooms.  As it is, it 'maps' them but sets all the exits to -1 as reported by the mud.  I figure I can make it map the maze rooms as if they were normal.  Then, on repop (or if I come back to the area much later) just have the mapper reset those rooms' exits back to -1.  It will re-map them next time you go through.  Built in maze mapper and pathing.'
@cStarling tells you 'xrunto will do that'
@cStarling tells you 'it's the main 'goto area' command in Search and Destroy'

@cStarling tells you 'If you install Search and Destroy, you can 'xrunto <area>' and it will take you to that area's default 'start room' as defined in the script's "default start rooms" table.  If you want to set a different start room for an area, you can do 'xset mark' to set the current room as the 'xrunto' target for that zone.'
@cYou tell Starling 'I'm nearly there. My plotter plugin takes advantage of the mapper and a couple of the other broadcasters in Basts library to quickly navigate around the globe after important things.'
@cYou tell Starling 'Oh okay'
@cYou tell Starling 'That is about what I was going to start pecking at next'
@cStarling tells you 'I want to add that to the mapper db, would just add it to the 'areas' table'
@cYou tell Starling 'search and destroy uses this mapper?'
@cYou tell Starling 'It would be so super simple to select room IDs by area'
@cYou tell Starling 'throw that into a goto the presto'
@cStarling tells you 'search and destroy uses the mapper to set up speedwalks to your campaign targets, but xrunto is useful all the time'
@cStarling tells you 'also has things like hunt trick, auto hunt, auto noexp to avoid over-levelling and missing cp's'
@cYou tell Starling 'I'll check it out. I use basts hunt and noexp plugin'

@cStarling tells you 'You should check it out anyway, might find some useful ideas in it.  It does speed up campaigning a fair bit, although you do need to map the areas, set up your cexits, and collect whatever keys you need'
@cYou tell Starling 'Set up a distribution for what and where they get killed'
@RGlobal Quest@Y:@w Mitsuda has completed @gGlobal Quest # 3718@w.
@cYou tell Starling 'The plotter is pretty much what the search and destroy is. It grabs the useful bits from quests, cp, gq and just general mischieve'

@RINFO: New post #@W147090@R in forum @WGquest@R from @WAardwolf@R Subj: @WLvl 89 to 100 - Global quest # 3718
@cStarling tells you 'That sounds really interesting'
@cYou tell Starling 'Let's you manipulate that data in fun ways. the first thing I did was override the where command so that it pops up with a mapper area <room>'
@cYou tell Starling 'With an alias for mapper next'
@cYou tell Starling 'It went from there'

@cYou tell Starling 'you're there'
@cYou tell Starling 'S&D?'
@cStarling tells you 'Search and Destroy'
@cYou tell Starling 'duh'
@cYou tell Starling 'Whos is it?'
@cStarling tells you 'That's pretty much what it does.  'xcp' to load info on first mob, if area cp it will also run you to zone and do the hunt trick to find the mob, then it does 'where' to get the room and build path.  Then 'go' to run to that room.  If mob not there, 'nx' to run to next possible room.  When found, you do 'kk' to kill it.'
@RINFO: Aeth is now a proven Art (of Melody) lover.
@cYou tell Starling 'Yes, exactly. I'm glad I wasn't the only one who saw that missing feature as a huge gaping whole that needed filling.'
@cYou tell Starling 'Does it combine quest cp and gp?'
@cStarling tells you 'the biggest issues remaining with it are the cross-plugin clunkiness issues, and excess target links when it's a room cp and a roomname exists in multiple zones'
@cYou tell Starling 'I use the same couple commands to plot my course, and it always gives priority to gqs, then quests, then cp'
@cStarling tells you 'It works on quests and cp's.'
@cYou tell Starling 'Yeah I ran into that too'
@cStarling tells you 'I was going to enable it for GQ to compete with the closed clan gq modded versions, but it was requested I not do that.'
@cYou tell Starling 'In fact in one of the early versions I plotted a course straight through some level 150 baddie zone on my way to a quest'
@cYou tell Starling 'I was about 12 at the time.'
@cStarling tells you 'I'm sure you made it just fine :)'
@cYou tell Starling 'Ahh I see'
@cStarling tells you 'I want to add a db to it though.  Simple one at first.  Just one table, with a 'mobname' and 'area' columns.  Idea is that if a room cp comes up, before displaying a target link, it'll run the mob name to see what areas it exists in.  If the same roomname exists in 8 areas, but the mobname exists in only one, no need to display all 8 links for one mob :p'

@RINFO: Dirtnaps has followed the path and become a believer.

@CRomantic gossips 'well, I'd love to know what is the name for this concept'

@GKinkakku questions 'does anyone know where the mad alchemist is in Dortmund'
@cStarling tells you 'most of the time, anyway.  Sometimes it even gets that wrong.  The idea is that the lowest numbered room id is probably the first room to be created when the area was built, and because it was the first room obviously it must link to the continent because why wouldn't it?  Makes sense but absolutely not true, that lowest roomid could be anywhere in the zone.  If the zone has high level aggros it becomes 'runto roulette''
@CFiendish gossips 'it's probably best to not think of it as there being no space, but more that below that size is fundamentally not measurable'

@cStarling tells you 'I already removed it though, it's gone from 1.3.4 and trying to match on the area long name is also gone, too many glitchy collisions and going to wrong area.  In 1.3.4 going forward only 'xrunt <area short id>' works, it will do partial matches on the area id's as well, and if no match then it just does 'areas keyword <what you entered>''

@cYou tell Cytan 'Why is it so much?'

@cYou tell Cytan 'I've been seriously adding to my portal collection'
@cYou tell Cytan 'I am an addict for sure.'
@cYou tell Cytan 'Up to 21 portals!'
@cYou tell Cytan 'What makes that one expensive? Is it extreamly hard to get?'
@cCytan tells you 'so there are two reasons why someone would do a portal collection.  Both reasons are getting to a room/area in few steps/fastest as possible.  The first reason someone would want to do that is gquests - time matters.  Second is just simple haste.  Faster campaigns, quests, etc.'
@cCytan tells you 'Lemme look up that goal solution, will tell you if hard.'

@RINFO: The player rankings have been updated.
@cYou tell Cytan 'My current project (which is still a little buggy but I'm proud of it) is an extensive mob database that helps all the other plugins.'
@cCytan tells you 'rock on.  so i used tintin++ for years and years, zmud/cmud a few yeras.  anyway, all have mappers which use gcmp to create a database of all rooms and their room IDs.'
@cYou tell Cytan 'That's why I'm addicted to the portals, makes overloading runto really quick'
@cCytan tells you 'the aardwolf version of MUSH supports mappers (that database)'
@cYou tell Cytan 'Yeah, I tap into the gmcp mapper on mushclient for my plugins.'
@cCytan tells you 'search and destroy plugin adds the algorthem to find the shortest distance from X to Y while including portals, level restrictions, etc.'
@cYou tell Cytan 'Yeah that's what I created, then after the fact I started chatting with Starling, and she told me about s&d'
@cCytan tells you 'so if you had a mapper and the algorthim in your client to answer the "travelling salesman problem" - going from x to y in shortest distance, portals are worth it.'
@cCytan tells you 'otherwise, it is not.'
@cCytan tells you 'yea, starling didn't create the s&d but is the de-facto admin of the code.'

@CZarra gossips 'and I think their friends relaying messages to me is a crime :P get over it :D'
@CAnaristos gossips 'well, if that is your solution you'll end up ignoring most of the players here. Which is too bad because we are all part of a nice big family and we do care for each other.'

Do I buy BP, gloves and bracers at 100 or work on some wishes? I am Cp'in from 1-50 then lvling out. Likely going to level to atleast T3, shooting for T5 or so before taking a lvling break. Looking for recommendations please'
@CMezemo gossips 'fair, I was just pointing out how Zarra basically insulted us all for the last five minutes calling us idiots. Like... why?'
@CKinkakku gossips 'everyone wants that nuclear household though'
@CAnaristos gossips 'well, she felt threatened. We've all been there.'

@CAnaristos gossips 'well, ideally a family should be composed of members who can contribute uniquely in such a way that the nucleus can be independent, hard to find a working combination, though.'
@CMezemo gossips 'I think we should use nuclear radiation to form super families'
@GEscobar answers 'EXPrate wish, too. It's just not as valuable pre-T3, imo.'
@CAnaristos gossips 'so someone with medical skills, one with legal skills, one with mechanical/engineering skills, etc'
@C(Gossip) Taeryn is the down quark in the nucleus.
@GZcrim answers 'sorry already have experate'
@GZcrim answers 'forgot to mention that'
@GLiber answers 'I'd go with wishes. I'm also not a fan of dual/20 levels, I'm more like one/10, but to each his own :)'
@GEscobar answers 'Gear is better than wishes early on.'
@GEscobar answers 'After Portal & Pockets1, they kind of fall off, in my opinion.'
@GLiber answers 'that ^^ really depends on playing style :D'
@GWars answers 'how is exasperate not as valuable pre t3? I would think the earlier you get it the more value it has overall'
@GEscobar answers 'Passdoor is useful but not necessary. Spellup is good, but with Bast spellup plugin, kinda negated.'
@GLiber answers 'nothing is necessary :)'
@GEscobar answers 'Because EXP tables were lowered, mobs HP lowered & things die much easier now.'
@GLiber answers 'and, for me, passdoor and fasthunt beat the importance of any aard piece I have'
@GEscobar answers 'Plus there's a lot of double going around.'
@GLiber answers 'with the exception of maybe aura/breastplate'
@GWars answers 'fast spellup is a huge timesaver'
@GEscobar answers 'Again, Spellup is nice but negated if you have Bast spellup.'
@GPwar answers 'negated??'
@GGrimvald answers 'there are a lot of options, zcrim, it's up to you how to combine them. I don't think there's any one way to play this game'
@GEscobar answers 'When it's auto casting every spell the second it drops, yeah.'
@GWars answers 'how so? even with auto respell you are still saving a ton of time between fights with fast spellup'
@GPwar answers 'respectfully disagree :p'
@GEscobar answers 'Disagree all you want. I could care less. I still think gear will get you to T3 faster than wishes ever will.'
@GTaeryn answers 'Just don't play this game naked in the middle of the park.  There might be objections and ramifications.'
@GGrimvald answers 'depends on the park'
@GZcrim questions 'whats the important of portal wear location, does the amulet have good stats? I thought it was only +2 to all?'
@GWars answers 'escobar if you cant see how fast spellup will speed your leveling i dont know how to help you. and no one said to ignore gear'
@GEscobar answers 'It's not just that portal, though. There's Gladiator's Arena portal. Tiger of Kai later on.'
@GZcrim answers 'so its having another gear slot that you can fill with better portals as you lvl?'

@CQuanah Parker@C says, @c"@CThere's been a pissing match going on between Marshall James and Mad Dog Jake fer a bunch of years now.  They're brothers, you see, so this all started back in when they were mites no bigger than the bee's knees.  Back then, Mrs. James, their mama, doted on the Marshall.  His younger brother, Jake, was pretty much left to his own devices, and spent his time killing off pet cats and pulling the wings offa flies.@c"
@CQuanah Parker@C says, @c"@CWell, comes the time they're adults, the Marshall now, he went fer the right side of the law.  That's not to say he's good at heart, cause that one's bad to the bone.  Doesn't mind taking a bitta blunt under the table fer his trouble, and will look the other way if you pays him enough.  But fer all that, he's the best bit of law we've got around here, and he generally kept things quiet like until his brother Jake came back into town.@c"
@CQuanah Parker@C says, @c"@CJake's not entirely a bad boy either.  He spends his days making his brother's life a misery, but doesn't mind helping out poor folk when he's got a little extra cash.@c"
@CQuanah Parker@C says, @c"@CNow, of course, they're so mad to get to each other, there ain't nothing like work gettin' done around here.  Mad Dog Jake's holed himself up in the mines, and Marshall James just keeps sending trigger happy idiots down there to root him out.  The townsfolk are getting a mite tired of all this.  So you've either gotta plug Mad Dog Jake, or take out Marshall James.  Really don't matter much to me which one you do, just do one of 'em.@c"

They're brothers, you see, so this all started back in when they were mites no bigger than the bee's knees.  Back then, Mrs. James, their mama, doted on the Marshall.  His younger brother, Jake, was pretty much left to his own devices, and spent his time killing off pet cats and pulling the wings offa flies.@c"
@CQuanah Parker@C says, @c"@CWell, comes the time they're adults, the Marshall now, he went fer the right side of the law.  That's not to say he's good at heart, cause that one's bad to the bone.  Doesn't mind taking a bitta blunt under the table fer his trouble, and will look the other way if you pays him enough.  But fer all that, he's the best bit of law we've got around here, and he generally kept things quiet like until his brother Jake came back into town.@c"
@CQuanah Parker@C says, @c"@CJake's not entirely a bad boy either.  He spends his days making his brother's life a misery, but doesn't mind helping out poor folk when he's got a little extra cash.@c"
@CQuanah Parker@C says, @c"@CNow, of course, they're so mad to get to each other, there ain't nothing like work gettin' done around here.  Mad Dog Jake's holed himself up in the mines, and Marshall James just keeps sending trigger happy idiots down there to root him out.  The townsfolk are getting a mite tired of all this.  So you've either gotta plug Mad Dog Jake, or take out Marshall James.  Really don't matter much to me which one you do, just do one of 'em.@c"

@cYou tell Starling 'yeah people are silly'
@cStarling tells you 'mobdb is what I predict will be the go-to solution in a post-S&D world'
@cYou tell Starling 'Well s&d will still be a thing, but it will be much more simple. just call a select from the mob db to get the keyword and the room_number'
@cYou tell Starling 'execute a "mapper goto <room_number>"'
@cStarling tells you 'I'll have to make a new version called S&D:PA - Search and Destroy:  Post Apocalyptic'

@cStarling tells you 'I'm thinking hard about merging the S&D triple pack into a single plugin.  What do you think?'
@cYou tell Starling 'does that include the auto hunt and what else?'
@cStarling tells you 'feature-identical to now, just all in one XML file'
@MAuction@w: An academy fundraising leaflet@M SOLD to Reltubydoc@M for @Y2,050,000 @Mgold.
@cYou tell Starling 'ahh'
@cYou tell Starling 'Well it might make it easier for someone to install, but it would be bad practice in general'
@cYou tell Starling 'should keep all the xml and lua libraries seperate'
@cYou tell Starling 'so it's easier to maintain'
@cYou tell Starling 'if you need to update or whatever'
@cStarling tells you 'You're the second person to mention something along those lines.  Why keep them separate?  They're intercommunicating already, and in general the plugins are used as a set, not separately'
@cYou tell Starling 'the xml can have some of the core script, but the big classes and logic you want to try and keep in it's own lua'
@cYou tell Starling 'well say you a lua library with a bunch of utility functions'
@cYou tell Starling 'like the tprint or to_lower_case or whatever'
@cYou tell Starling 'keep it seperate means another plugin can just require "utilities.lua" without having to rewrite anything'
@cYou tell Starling 'you are already no doubt require some of the base lua lirbaries, which it part of lua'
@cYou tell Starling 'shouldnt go with your xml'
@cYou tell Starling 'the constants for instance'

@cYou tell Starling 'like in talsa how you need to wear the clothes and give the chick some veggies, then give the dude some gloves, then give the guy a ring'
@cYou tell Starling 'have the mapper or a helper script gather that crap and make sure you are wearing it'
@cStarling tells you 'If you do the goal you don't need that stuff'

@GRaynecaster questions 'Is there any way to remove the invisible flag on an item other than the spell from a player?'
@GDethavin answers 'In the end it's a personal choice, S/D, S^D, SD, Or however you choose to type it is just a nice helper to have once you fully have areas mapped out. You have to put a ton of work into it and the mapper for it to work as intended anyway. So those saying its better to not use it so you have to learn the areas are slightly wrong (imo) due to the fact that you have to map the entire area in the first place for it to be 100% effective. But thats my thoughts/opinion on it. /shrug'

@GGritznakka answers 'Heal'
@GRaynecaster answers 'Thanks'
@GDaak answers 'heal starts at 60'
@GGritznakka answers 'Don't use pots below heal.'
@GRaynecaster questions 'What's the level 80 version?'
@GSivak answers 'healing somtimes its called'
@GGritznakka answers 'There isn't one'
@GDaak answers 'potsearch heal'
@GRaynecaster answers 'Ah.'
@GGritznakka answers 'Heal doesn't scale with level, so you will always use level 60 heals.'
@GMograth answers 'I used the minor healing a lot to keep from having to stop fighting before I get to 60'
@GMograth answers 'they do well enough, just need lots of them.'
@GRaynecaster questions 'Is there a tier above heal for level 80, or is heal it?'
@GGritznakka answers 'There are spells, but you're going to mostly stick to using heal pots.'
@GDurel answers 'level 60 heal is basically it until 200/201.  The good news is that it scales with wis, not level so it does get stronger'
@GTrurien answers 'I think 60 is the max, but you have renew at 98 if you're a cleric.'
@GRaynecaster answers 'I was referring potions actually.'

@GShavrendil questions 'I was wondering - is it known how dr and average damage relate to each other? Or more specifically, how much you need to tpenchant an aard weapon to equal one that's 10 or 20 levels higher?'
@GDaak answers 'To the second question, aard weapons get +1 HR/DR every 10 levels, tpenchant give +1 HR/DR (+2 if lucky)'
@GDaak answers 'So a tpenchant = 10 levels in that repect, but tpenchant does not increase the avg damage of the weapon'
@GLiber answers 'no, but the average damage is only one of the factors'
@GLiber answers 'hitroll/damroll are also nice'
@GShavrendil answers 'Yes, so if I tpenchant it once or twice they'll have the same dr, but the higher level one will still hit harder.'

@G(Answer) Liber shrugs helplessly.
@GDaak answers 'Does weapon damage factor into spell damage?'
@GDurel answers 'you could probably figure out how avedam translates to dr by extensively testing things with dtrack'
@GSirCanada answers 'it's not that clear cut, because you have hr/dr from other sources'
@GLiber answers 'imho, considering the cost of tpenchant, if you plan to cover the level gap by tpenchanting, you're doing it wrong. but that's just me (and I do mean it, there are people with a weapon every 50 levels or something)'
@GDurel answers 'It's a good question though.  I have several weapons and then got a max enchanted one on auction fairly cheaply.  The question is how long to use the max enchanted lower-level weapon instead of a higher level one without the extra hr/dr.  I don't have the answer yet, but it should be possible to determine it using dtrack over time'
@GShavrendil questions 'I plan to eventually max-tpenchant at least one weapon every 20 levels (I know it's about 1.5k tps, that's a long-term plan). So I'm thinking about what to use in the meantime.'
@GShavrendil questions 'I will probably end up checking it with dtrack as well. Thanks!'
